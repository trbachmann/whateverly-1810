    "episodeSynopsis": "Elliot is a young programmer in New York City who works as a cyber-security engineer by day and as a vigilante hacker by night. He's a loner and occasional drug user with a social phobia of being around most people. He believes in using his computing talents to help those he cares about, as well as to punish those he believes are bringing harm to others. Elliot discovers that the owner of a coffee shop he frequents is hiding a terrible criminal secret. Uncharacteristically confronting the owner in person, Elliot tells him how he uncovered the information, and then leaves just as the police arrive. Elliot also hacks his best friend Angela to keep watch over her, and his psychologist to protect her from unscrupulous suitors. At his day job at a cyber-security firm, Elliot thwarts a hack on their biggest client, but in the process discovers some secret lines of code meant for his eyes only. He chooses to leave the code in place, curious to see the meaning of it. On his way home on the subway, Elliot is approached by man with a \"Mr. Robot\" patch on his jacket. The stranger appears to be a down-on-his-luck drifter, but Elliot has seen him before and surmises that he's been following Elliot. The stranger confirms that Elliot left the secret code in place, and then leads him to Coney Island. Once there, Elliot is introduced to a secret team of hackers who are determined to bring their version of justice to the world. Elliot must now choose -- he can either continue as a lone vigilante, or risk both his anonymity and potential freedom by joining this mysterious group. They seem to be as talented and driven as he is – but as Elliot soon learns, entry may come with a cost.",
    "titleExplanation": "A Quicktime format. The root is a reference to “Hello World,” a simple message program used to teach the most essential aspects in a programming language. The “Hello” command was also used as a “sanity test” to not only make sure the disc and the computer were speaking the same language, but also whether it’s possible or reasonable to proceed, if the language’s compiler, development, and run-time environment are correctly installed. (We all know by now that in Elliot’s case, he’s got … a run-time error). It also refers to the video file fsociety had left to recruit Elliot (Rami Malek), which he finds when he tracks down the source of the E Corp denial-of-service hack. The DDoS attack, in a way, is also a sanity test –- to see what E Corp’s security is like and find its weaknesses. “Hello friend” are the first words used in some email worms, and “Hello friend” are the first words Elliot says to us, the audience. (“Hello friend. Hello friend? That’s lame. Maybe I should give you a name, but that’s a slippery slope. You’re only in my head. We have to remember that.”)",

    "episodeSynopsis": "Tyrell Wellick, now Evil Corp’s acting CTO since Elliot helped get Terry Colby arrested, makes Elliot an offer he can (and does) refuse: a position as Evil Corp’s head of Cyber Security and a big bank account to match. By saying no, has Elliot made himself a mark for Wellick? Back at work, everyone is still in shock that Terry Colby was arrested. Elliot anxiously waits for Mr. Robot to contact him again until Gideon shows him fsociety’s video demanding that their “leader,” Terry Colby, be released and that all people get released from their debt in addition to Evil Corp dissolving their company and donating all their assets to charities around the world. If their demands aren’t met, they will dump terabytes worth of emails and files that they acquired during the breach, none of which makes any sense to Elliot. None of that was part of the plan. Was he just a pawn in Mr. Robot’s scheme? Just when he has decided that he needs to cut off all ties with fsociety, Elliot finds Darlene, one of the fsociety hackers, in his apartment. She takes him back to their HQ in Coney Island, where Mr. Robot shares the next part of the plan: to blow up a natural gas plant in Albany that’s right next to Steel Mountain, the offsite data storage operation for every corporation in the SMP including Evil Corp. Elliot refuses to participate—he’s not killing anyone—but Mr. Robot says if he walks out the door, then he has made his choice to do nothing, just like his father did, and he will no longer be a part of the revolution. Meanwhile, Shayla’s drug supplier, Fernando Vera, who’s also the source of Elliot’s precious morphine and suboxone (a withdrawal med that Elliot takes as a precaution against becoming addicted) has started taken advantage of Shayla’s financial dependence on him. Despite Elliot’s urging, Shayla refuses to turn him in. Elliot has a stake in this game too, because (though he can deny it all he wants) he needs those drugs, and he can’t let Fernando keep drugging and raping Shayla. Suddenly Elliot feels like his choices are non-choices. But can he get past his feelings of helplessness and anger to figure out a way to do something on terms he can live with?",
    "titleExplanation": "A compressed audio or video file. The root is a reference to base-2 math, which is the foundation of binary code, the building block of all computer systems, because it’s easier to translate on an electrical level (on/off, or to be more exact, high/low voltage). Elliot has to make a binary decision, to choose one of two opposing sides -– remain passive and work with E Corp, or become active and join fsociety. (“Are you a one or a zero? Are you a yes or no?”) He has to decide if the two are truly in opposition -– is one good, and the other evil? Are fsociety the good guys? Or is life not that binary? ",

    "episodeSynopsis": "After being shoved off the railing in Coney Island by Mr. Robot, Elliot wakes up in a hospital room, badly banged up. Krista, his psychiatrist, is inclined to send him to rehab unless he’s willing to be regularly drug tested. Elliot complies, knowing that he can easily change the hospital records for the tests since he hacked their system long ago. Mr. Robot shows up at Allsafe to convince Elliot to speak to him. Mr. Robot apologizes for acting out against Elliot and explains there is no plan without Elliot. But Elliot is done with Mr. Robot and fsociety and decides instead that it’s time for him to lead a “normal” life. He asks Shayla to be his girlfriend and accepts a dinner invitation with his fellow co-workers at Gideon’s apartment. Tyrell Wellick’s hopes for ascension are temporarily dashed when his much anticipated meeting to pitch Evil Corp’s CEO about becoming Colby’s replacement is postponed. Making matters worse, the CEO tells him he’s got a stellar CTO candidate on the hook. Not one to be so easily deterred, that night Tyrell lures the CEO’s assistant, Anwar, into a tryst in order to gain access to his smartphone to get the intel on the prospective CTO. Just as ambitious as her husband and seemingly aligned with his unorthodox tactics, Tyrell’s pregnant wife, Joanna, helps him plot his next move. Ollie has been given an ultimatum from the mysterious hacker who has been spying on his online activity: if he doesn’t infect Allsafe’s servers, his dirty secrets, along with compromising images and sensitive information about Angela, will be sold. When Ollie comes clean with Angela, including about his affair with Stella, her first reaction is to break up with him and implores him to do what the hacker instructed. But doing so would jeopardize both of their jobs, which neither of them can afford to lose. Now what? At Gideon’s dinner party, Elliot makes a valiant effort to act “normal” until he gets a breaking news alert about Evil Corp and turns on the TV. The hackers have released emails that reveal that Terry Colby was among other high level executives involved in the cover up of a Washington Township toxic waste leak in 1993 that was linked to 26 employees, including Elliot’s father and Angela’s mother, dying of leukemia two years later. Elliot walks out the door without a word and heads to fsociety. The hackers, including Mr. Robot, watch him as he takes out his laptop and connects it. He’s ready to execute the next phase of the plan.",
    "titleExplanation": "An open-standard file format with multiple audio/video tracks in one file, typically used on torrent sites. The root is a reference to debugging, the process of problem-solving computer code, and finding bugs planted that might make code run improperly. Elliot applies this thinking to his life: “I’m gonna lead a bug-free life from now on,” he says. But after his attempts at a so-called normal life, free from fscociety, it becomes clear that this won’t be possible –- that Elliot might be the bug itself. And then Elliot realizes Colby was essentially a bug, too.",

    "episodeSynopsis": "At fsociety, Elliot lays out his plan to hack Steel Mountain’s climate control system and raise the heat high enough to melt all the tapes that record the data. Romero points out the plan’s many flaws but when Elliot remembers that they only have a few days left before Evil Corp switches over to their new redundant security protocols based on what Tyrell Wellick told him, they reluctantly agree it’s now or never. Unfortunately, “now” coincides with when Elliot is trying to kick his morphine habit. His detox winds up delaying the implementation of their plan by a crucial thirty-six hours. Even so, Mr. Robot stays by Elliot’s side because he believes that Elliot is the only force of nature at play here. While the men of fsociety are on the road to Albany, Darlene and Trenton try to make contact with Darlene’s connection at the Dark Army to tee them up to work on a parallel path to ensure Steel Mountain’s backup data is destroyed. After a failed attempt to track him down at his usual Sunday hangout, Darlene and Trenton are picked up in a black stretch limo and taken to where Cisco, Darlene’s ex boyfriend and the guy who has been blackmailing Ollie, is hanging out. She explains that Dark Army’s piece of the plan needs to go down tomorrow but he says that the guys he works for aren’t motivated by the same “free the masses, free the world” stuff as she and her cronies are. She begs him to talk to them. After an excruciating, hallucination-filled couple of days, the worst of Elliot’s withdrawal finally seems to be over. They resume their journey in their stolen minivan toward Steel Mountain. There’s no turning back now.",
    "titleExplanation": "A compressed audio/video file format which has replaced avi as the most common format for illegal files. The root is “daemon,” a computer program which runs in the background to help keep an OS running smoothly, without the user having control over it. (Usually low-level tasks, such as temperature control). Daemons are named after a thought experiment, Maxwell’s Demon, which would allow for the second law of thermodynamics to be violated, and sociologists have applied this thinking as a metaphor for socioeconomic inequality. (Apt, considering what fsociety hopes to do). Elliot also sees the daemon as a metaphor for the unconscious –- “primal urges, repressed memories, unconscious habits.” Elliot has many of these, including how Mr. Robot (Christian Slater) is a daemon his brain’s computer has been running in the background.",

    "episodeSynopsis": "Mr. Robot, Elliot, Romero and Mobley have gained access to Steel Mountain’s parking lot. Now it’s up to a nervous Elliot to pose as a tech billionaire touring the facility so he can plant the device on a thermostat. When Elliot finally manages to shrug off his tour guide, he runs right into Tyrell Wellick. Elliot bluffs about why he’s there and then quickly figures out how to use having lunch with Tyrell as a way of gaining access to the restricted floor. Then Elliot excuses himself to go to the bathroom, where he starts installing the device in the adjacent janitor closet, but Tyrell’s entrance halts his progress. Tyrell says he knows that Elliot framed Terry Colby for the Evil Corp hack, but he believes Elliot did so as revenge for his father’s death, which lessens Tyrell’s opinion of him. After saying that he isn’t going to bother to turn him in, Tyrell leaves, giving Elliot the precious chance he needs to finish the job. Angela breaks up with Ollie and moves out of their apartment, but not before telling him that she infected Allsafe’s network with the hacker’s CD using his work ID and his computer. When she arrives at her dad’s house in New Jersey, he sweetly offers her some money to help her until she gets back on her feet. That night, however, she upsettingly discovers stacks of her father’s unpaid bills, many of which are owed to Evil Corp. Now what? Tyrell and his wife Joanna have arranged to have dinner with the Evil Corp CTO candidate and his wife, Scott and Sharon Knowles, at the other couple’s apartment. Tyrell tells Scott that he knows he’s been tapped by Evil Corp to be their next CTO and lobbies to be considered as Scott’s new right-hand man, even though Scott makes it clear that he doesn’t trust Tyrell. After dinner, Tyrell makes Sharon think that he’s seducing her but when she acquiesces, Tyrell leaves her hanging. When Darlene communicates to the Dark Army that she’s ready for them to run their script to destroy the backup data, they unexpectedly shut down her request and cut off communication with her. She tracks down her ex Cisco who tells her that the Dark Army was out before her crew ever got to Steel Mountain but he doesn’t know why. When the guys return to the arcade, Darlene tells them she lost China. She is hell bent on going forward with taking down Steel Mountain anyway but Mr. Robot argues it will blow their chance to achieve their bigger goal. Elliot helps calm her and she backs down. Knowing that she’s upset, he offers for her to crash at his place. When they get there, Shayla’s door is open and the dog is barking but there’s no sign of Shayla. Her cell phone rings and it’s Fernando Vera who says that even though he is locked away, the universe has brought Elliot right to him.", 
    "titleExplanation": "An early file compression format generally used by Windows, designed to compete with Quicktime. The root, “exploit,” is a sequence of commands that leverage vulnerabilities in a computer system. (Essentially, a hack). Here, fsociety attempts to plant an exploit to infiltrate Steel Mountain, but that’s not the only thing being hacked. People make the best exploits, as Elliot tells us. And so Elliot exploits the innocence of a low-level employee, while Tyrell Wellick (Martin Wallström) tries to exploit the wife of a rival, to hack the executive hiring process, and possibly Elliot as well. It’s all just social engineering.",

    "episodeSynopsis": "Elliot is given only a few moments to talk to Shayla in a diner before Vera’s henchmen, his brother Isaac and colleague DJ, drag her out. The only way Vera will let her go is if Elliot hacks the jail and gets Vera released by that night, which even for Elliot is an impossible task. Isaac and DJ bring Elliot back to his apartment and stay to keep watch over him as he works. Elliot enlists Darlene to help him get into the jail’s network, but their trick fails and she also ends up getting held by the thugs in Elliot’s apartment until he successfully completes his task. At the Allsafe office before work hours, Angela busily works the phones, trying to reach the lawyers who pleaded the case for the victims’ families in the Washington Township scandal. She finally gets a call back from one of them and rushes over to see her. Angela tells the lawyer, Antara Nayar, that she scoured the data dumps from the Evil Corp hack and found new evidence to help the case against them. Though Antara would love nothing more than to take down Evil Corp, she said it’s impossible without finding someone reliable who was there when the decision was made to falsify the chemical waste intel and would now be willing to testify. Angela goes to see Terry Colby at his townhouse but he doesn’t remotely recognize her and turns her away. Tyrell visits Scott Knowles in the Evil Corp conference room between Scott’s interviews for the CTO job. Scott knows that Tyrell is angry that he got passed over for the job but he also is aware that Tyrell came on to his wife because she told him every sordid detail. Scott tells Tyrell in no uncertain terms that he will never be CTO. At home that night, Joanna calmly points out to her raging husband that now they know that Sharon’s weak spot is that she wants to be wanted, which could be useful if they play it right. After going outside to divert Angela who was frantically ringing his apartment buzzer, Elliot finds Mr. Robot waiting for him in the stairwell. Mr. Robot begs Elliot to drop this whole thing, even if it means sacrificing Shayla, because it’s too risky and Elliot has a much greater calling. But Elliot won’t give up. He hatches a new plan, knowing that even if he succeeds, there’s no guarantee that he, Shayla and Darlene won’t be killed by the completely insane Vera or his men, no matter how well he plays his side of this twisted game.",

    "episodeSynopsis": "A month has passed since everything went down with Shayla and Vera. Elliot has just fulfilled the court-ordered mandate of a year of therapy. Krista signs his papers while urging him to continue their work. His response is to take his completed form and leave. After a few days, however, Elliot returns to her office. It all comes spilling out—that he’s a hacker and to prove it, recounts details about her that he would never know otherwise, stunning her into silence. He desperately wants a way out of this loneliness, just like her. Is that what she’s been wanting to hear? Angela and the lawyer Antara Nayar request a meeting with Terry Colby through his legal team, dangling information that could help his case as incentive. Colby’s lawyers grant it on the conditions that Antara can get Colby immunity and that Angela meets with him alone. When Angela arrives at Colby’s townhouse for the meeting, she tells him if he agrees to testify against the execs who covered up the illegal dumping of epoxy resin waste in the Washington Township scandal, she will testify that she broke the chain of custody with the DAT file that’s central to his case. At first he turns her down in the most insulting, sexist way possible but somehow her words get through to him and he’s reluctantly willing to play ball. Mr. Robot tells Darlene that they need to somehow talk to whiterose directly to get the Dark Army back in their camp. Since she’s been frozen out, she’s been trying to send messages to the Dark Army by hacking Cisco’s system but so far, no dice. Besides, she says, tape backups have already shipped out to the new Steel Mountain facilities but Mr. Robot reveals that he has put a plan in motion. When Cisco figures out that Darlene has hacked his system, he says he’s done with her for good, but incredibly, the meeting with whiterose is on. Now Darlene and Mr. Robot need to reassemble the fsociety team—no easy task since Trenton and Romero seem too disillusioned by their recent failure to return. At the reception to welcome Scott Knowles to Evil Corp as the new CTO, Tyrell sidles up to his wife Sharon. She’s disappointed that he gave up his pursuit so easily. Encouraged by her flirtation, he “orders” her to meet him on the roof. When she joins him, she tells Tyrell that she sees through his manipulations and that Scott is planning to fire him. In return, he tells her she needs this because she’s dissatisfied. They start kissing fervently and then, swept up in a fit of uncontrollable rage, he strangles her to death. Shocked by what he has done, he wipes the saliva from both of their mouths and runs.",

The Allsafe team is scrambling to fix the hack and keep news of it from leaking to their clients. While Elliot tries to reverse engineer the malware, he wonders if the hack is just a distraction, and if so, from what. After Ollie oddly orders Elliot to take some infected drives to Blank’s Disk Recovery, Elliot starts putting the clues together and realizes that all of this is an elaborate plan to lead Elliot to his meeting with whiterose. In the three minutes the imposing and extremely time-sensitive whiterose has allotted to speak to Elliot, she tells Elliot that the Dark Army hacked Allsafe because Gideon has been tracking Elliot’s moves on the Evil Corp server, creating a very serious vulnerability for them all. Disappointed by Elliot’s grave misstep, whiterose charges Elliot with removing Gideon’s “honeypot” within the next fifty hours to or the Dark Army will not only walk away from the Steel Mountain plan but also Elliot will also suffer some personal consequences. Meanwhile, Tyrell is becoming unhinged since strangling Sharon Knowles the night before. The detectives show up at his office to question him, but he manages to put them off—temporarily at least. Joanna thinks their original plan is still in play and that Tyrell got photos of Sharon and him having sex on the roof. He’s too afraid to tell her that not only did he fail, but also he has colossally derailed their dreams. Out of desperation, Tyrell goes to meet a very unexpected colleague: Mr. Robot.",

Mr. Robot explains that Elliot is not well and that “they” have been feeding him pills so he forgets what they want him to forget. Mr. Robot, nervous that the men in black will hear them, especially because they don’t want Mr. Robot to be alive, takes Elliot to their old house in Washington Township. Mr. Robot has a different take on the window incident that Elliot just can’t reconcile with his own memories. Unable to stand it anymore, Elliot pushes Mr. Robot out of his bedroom window. Darlene, who has been frantically looking for Elliot, calls Angela for help, their shared history and cooperation to keep that fact from Elliot now apparent. Still hurt by Elliot’s abandonment of their friendship, Angela is unwilling to join the search, especially since Darlene won’t tell her what’s really going on and her recent reappearance has only made Elliot worse. Back in New Jersey, Angela’s father mentions that he saw Darlene in town, so Angela goes to Darlene and Elliot’s old house and finds Darlene who has come to look for Elliot there but the house is empty. Then they see that the broken window in Elliot’s old bedroom, which they take as a sign that he’s been there. At Mr. Robot’s urging, he and Elliot go to the town cemetery. They hear Darlene and Angela calling his name. Mr. Robot says he will never leave Elliot again but “they” are going to try to get rid of him again so he needs Elliot to not let them. Elliot is upset and confused. What does Mr. Robot mean? Where is he going? When the girls reach Elliot, they ask him who’s he talking to.

    "episodeSynopsis": "Elliot wakes up in Tyrell’s SUV in a Manhattan parking lot. He’s been asleep inside for two days and has no memory of how he got there or what happened to Tyrell since he brought him to the fsociety arcade. As Elliot makes his way through the city, he realizes that the fsociety plan was executed. Credit card systems are no longer working but everyone’s debt has been erased. Governments and corporations the world over are dealing with the fallout from the hack while people are celebrating fsociety and their newfound freedom in the streets. Meanwhile, Angela has taken the job Terry Colby offered her at Evil Corp in the PR department but every part of the conglomerate has been thrown into chaos by the hack. The company has been scrambling to recover their data but the possibility of doing so is so bleak that the acting EVP of Technology shoots himself during an interview on live television just a few feet away from Angela. The shocking incident brings her to the attention of Evil Corp’s CEO, Phillip Price, who takes the time to talk to her in the midst of the crisis. She seems to be both impressed and repulsed by him. Will she lose sight of her goal of changing the world from within and become one of them? Or is she realizing that her objective may be futile? Still dazed, Elliot arrives at the arcade but the team is not happy. Darlene has been looking for him for two days and everyone else is pissed that Elliot executed solo, not together as they had planned. But Elliot’s mind is elsewhere because he still can’t piece together what happened to Tyrell. He’s also disillusioned by the reality of their revolution. Why isn’t he enjoying this? This isn’t what he pictured. Why didn’t Tyrell try to stop him? When Elliot sees the fsociety masked man declare victory in a video, he suddenly realizes that he’s been the masked man all along. He can no longer blame Mr. Robot for all of this—because he is Mr. Robot. And there doesn’t seem to be anything he can do about it other than go home and enjoy the “beautiful carnage” they have created.",

    "episodeSynopsis": "As it turns out, revolutions aren’t achieved in one day. That’s the unfortunate rude awakening that the members of fsociety experience in the first episode of the second season of Mr. Robot. While Elliot has given up the fight, Darlene continues to soldier on, determined to make good on fsociety’s promise and finish the job. But something continues to gnaw at Elliot’s brain—whether it’s Mr. Robot, the ghost of his dead father, Elliot’s own conscience, we really don’t know—and moving on may be more than a few monotonous discussions of Seinfeld over limp diner food can achieve. Elliot doesn’t remember what he did during the three days after the hack on 5/9, including what happened to Tyrell Wellick after he showed up at fsociety. So he has retreated to his mother’s house and for the last month, has taken refuge—of sorts—in his “perfectly constructed loop,” a monotonous routine devoid of computers, Internet access, and anything resembling mental stimulation. Elliot’s dream about revolution didn’t succeed. The world has been thrown into economic chaos and Evil Corp still stands. He has returned to meeting with Krista, the psychiatrist whose personal life he ruined, in the hopes of drowning out the needling voice of Mr. Robot in his head. However, no amount of journaling with a dull pencil has driven away the relentless demands of Elliot’s alter ego to stop his “zombie act” and get back in the game. “I am not a tumor to be excised!” Mr. Robot argues. “I am an organ vital to your existence!” But until Mr. Robot tells Elliot what happened to Tyrell, which he refuses to do, Elliot remains on the bench, locking them in a twisty kind of stalemate. Despite her tears behind her heart-shaped sunglasses, Darlene is determined to keep the revolution on track. Mobley is mostly still on board, but without Elliot (who we now know is her brother!), Darlene doesn’t have anyone she can truly count on, who is taking their mission as seriously as she is. Sawing off the balls of the bull statue on Wall Street is meaningless bull-s%&#, not progress. After driving out Evil Corp’s General Counsel, Susan Jacobs, from her tricked-out smart house loft by making her ultra wired home system go haywire, Darlene and her misguided band of merry hackers secretly install themselves there to plot out their next move. Darlene warns them that Susan Jacobs isn’t known as “Madame Executioner” for nothing so they have to take down her and the rest of Evil Corp before Evil Corp does the job first. Meanwhile, the FBI won’t stop harassing Gideon, who has been nothing but cooperative with the authorities as he tries to clear AllSafe’s name, as well as his own, from any wrongdoing. He visits Elliot at his mother’s house and begs for his old employee’s help, while Mr. Robot taunts Elliot from the sidelines. When Elliot says no (to Mr. Robot? to Gideon? to both?), Gideon threatens to go to the FBI with what he knows -- or doesn't know, but suspects -- about Elliot. Between the two of them, it’s unclear who wins the prize for being the most desperate about their shrinking options. #tooclosetocall. Per Darlene’s command, fsociety’s next target is Evil Corp Bank. The demand: $5.9 million delivered to Battery Park City by a chief executive of the company. The consequence: the entire bank system will be bricked in twenty-four hours. The newly widowed Scott Knowles, Evil Corp’s now CTO, is against negotiating with these “terrorists.” But Susan Jacobs says that while the FBI won’t sanction them paying the ransom, they can’t afford to wait the five days for IT to fix their system. Besides, according to Madame Executioner, a few million is nothing but couch cushion change. (Please hold while we look underneath our couch cushions…damn. Only a linty penny.) CEO Phillip Price decides that they need to pay them off and Scott volunteers to deliver the money. At the appointed hour, Scott shows up with the requisite briefcases full of C-notes. A bike messenger asks Scott to sign for a duffle bag, which contains an fsociety mask and instructions. He has 10 seconds to execute the demand or every bank system will be bricked. As directed, Scott dumps all the cash on the sidewalk, pours lighter fluid all over it, and sets the whole pile on fire. Then he drops the mask on the pyre as Darlene watches amidst bewildered onlookers, the expression on her illuminated face inscrutable before she turns and walks away.",

    "episodeSynopsis": "Ray, the guy with the droopy dog who tries to befriend Elliot at the neighborhood basketball court, sums up the second part of the premiere episode of Mr. Robot best: “Maybe truth don’t even exist. Maybe what we think is all we got.” In a meeting with the National Economic Council in DC, Phillip Price tries to secure another bailout. But the Feds have already committed $900 billion, which Evil Corp has somehow managed to burn through in 30 days, and are unwilling to commit more. What they want is his resignation. But Price, in a spectacular display of pomposity, schools the council on how it’s the government’s job to lie to the American people as we later learned that FDR so successfully did during The Great Depression. Price argues that if he resigns, then any scrap of confidence the public is clinging to will be destroyed. “We all know a con doesn’t work without the confidence. If this was the best idea you’ve come up with for a win, then I shouldn’t be the one resigning,” he says as a parting shot. Guess who’s getting his additional bailout? Guess who’s paying the “price”? Angela’s affirmations sure do seem to be working. After only thirty days on the job (with an ECorp exec offing himself on live TV just inches away from her on her first day) she’s killing it, so to speak, in the press department. She doesn’t take any crap from catty co-workers or cranky reporters as she craftily negotiates an exclusive press interview on her very restrictive terms. Bolstered by her coup, she later meets Antara, the public defender on the Washington Township case, for a drink and tells her that she’s not quitting her job even though their plan was for it to be temporary. After wrestling her dropped jaw back into place, Antara says she thinks that ECorp is up to something shady and Angela doesn’t see it. Considering how high her nose is raised in the air, it makes sense that Angela doesn’t see anything other than her own ambition. Before leaving, Antara relays a pointed story about a woman who gets propositioned in a bar for money. And on cue, Angela goes home with the guy who fills Antara’s empty barstool. Instead of smoking a post-coital cigarette, Angela soothes herself with more affirmations. After yet more questioning by the FBI, Gideon hits a bar for a stiff drink. A guy sits beside him and starts commenting on the news of the recent hacks playing on the TV above the bar. The guy then says he recognizes Gideon from TV, which both unnerves and relaxes Gideon, especially when it seems as if the man is sympathetic to Gideon’s plight…that is, until he cryptically mentions that tomorrow he’s going to be a hero. Just as Gideon did, we wondered what the heck that meant. “This is for our country,” the stranger says as he whips out a gun and shoots Gideon in the neck—putting a tragic end to the ultimate fall guy’s life. RIP Gideon Goddard. Joanna certainly hasn’t let the birth of her baby or the disappearance of her husband preclude her from her leather-bound extracurricular activities. But with the swirling speculation around Tyrell’s possible connection to Sharon Knowles’ death all over the news, Joanna must be discreet about her indiscretions. She scratches an itch with a handsome young man in a swanky hotel room but is careful to keep herself under the radar with the help of a bodyguard. When she returns home with baby Noah, she finds a wrapped gift on the doorstep. Inside is a music box with a burner phone taped to the bottom. Just as Murphy’s Law would predict, after hours of waiting, the phone only rings when she leaves it to attend to her crying infant. Care to speculate on who the “Unknown Caller” is? Despite staying the course on his carefully calibrated regimen and staying away from the computer in the desperate hope of unplugging Mr. Robot, Elliot realizes that he’s still losing time when his “mask takes over.” So Elliot confronts Mr. Robot, who, no surprise, continues to push back. Instead of crumbling, Elliot begins to laugh, more maniacally than mirthfully. “Tell me what I want to hear. Tell me where Tyrell is. Or shoot me again. Because the only person it’s going to drive mad is you, not me.” Turning the tables on yourself is no easy feat (we didn’t really know that was possible until now), but Elliot manages to do it, and voila, Mr. Robot actually backs down—for now. During church group, Elliot nods off and wakes up at his mother’s house with an old phone to his ear, the line on the other end ringing as if Elliot has initiated the call. The line picks ups. “Is it really you?” the voice asks. Elliot then asks who it is (even though, come on, we’d know that accent anywhere). After a pause the voice says, “Bonsoir, Elliot.” Bingo. Ladies and gentleman, we have an ID on the Unknown Caller: Tyrell Wellick. He’s alive! (Whew! Or oh no!—not sure yet.) But is he the same as Joanna’s Unknown Caller?",

    "episodeSynopsis": "Post 5/9, the stakes keep rising. Gideon has just been killed and now in this episode, an fsociety member also finds himself on the losing side of a gun. Meanwhile, the dude that Elliot would really like to get rid of remains impervious to every method of deletion. It’s only fitting that Mobley, who originally recruited Romero into fsociety – while striking a deal for the potentially cursed Coney Island arcade -- is the one to find Romero lying in a pool of his own blood amidst his pot plants. Not only does his murder spook Mobley and Trenton (though Darlene not so much), but it also gets on the radar of the authorities, including Dominique “Dom” DiPierro, the FBI agent from the Cyber National Security Division who was questioning Gideon in the last episode. Her name appears on the few printed pages of a famously hacked FBI roster Romero had in his mother’s house. And Dom, who happens to be a bit of a socially phobic insomniac herself (sounds kinda like the profile of many hackers…hmmm), wants to know why. Her extracurricular sleuthing at Mrs. Romero’s house pays off when she unearths a flyer for the End of the World party, emblazoned with DJ Mobley’s name…which eventually leads her to the arcade. Think we’re about to find out why the “U” and the “N” are missing from “FUN” on the original arcade sign. While on the phone with Tyrell, Elliot demands to know what’s going on and what happened that night, but Tyrell says it’s not safe to talk about that. Mr. Robot appears out of nowhere (he’s so good at that) and slams down the phone. The call, it turns out, was Mr. Robot’s bargaining chip: he let Elliot talk to the most wanted man on the planet, just like he wanted. What Elliot really wants, however, is for the panic to finally stop. But once he hears on the news that Gideon was shot dead in a bar, Elliot realizes the chances of that are nil. Phillip Price calls Angela into his office and relays a litany of changes he wants made to the interview she fought so hard to set up. Fighting her Old Angela urges to swallow her opinion and walk away, the New Angela boldly tells him she thinks that what he’s asking is a mistake. Phillip rewards her ballsiness by both backing down and inviting her to dinner. She’s speechless but there’s a satisfied glimmer in her eye. Her confidence balloon deflates somewhat, however, when she saunters into the restaurant a few nights later and finds two E Corp execs seated at Phillip’s table. It isn’t until the plates are cleared and Phillip dismisses the two men that Angela learns what the last couple of hours have been all about. Despite the charity work these two dedicated family men have done for the company over many years, they were both in the room with Colby when he was covering up the leak in her hometown. More recently, they’ve been involved in some serious insider trading. Slick as oil, he slides a CD across the table to her. There’s enough evidence in there to put them away for years, he says. When he starts to leave, New Angela speaks up once again. “Whatever you’re doing, I don't trust it.” Phillip leans in awfully close. He understands her panic, he coos into her ear, because she’ll be ruining their lives. But the minute she removes emotion from it, she’ll do just fine. And with that, the self-proclaimed “Master of the Universe” strides out. Darlene and Mobley have convened at Trenton’s house. Mobley and Trenton are convinced the Dark Army is behind Romero’s death and possibly Gideon’s too. Even though Darlene has been the main contact with the Dark Army and she has never mentioned the names of her fsociety colleagues, Mobley worries that in Elliot’s messed up state, he may be saying things he shouldn’t. Darlene grudgingly agrees to speak to Elliot to calm them the eff down. After she leaves, Mobley says to Trenton that he thinks Darlene and Elliot are trying to cover their tracks, and that they’re the tracks. Is Ray an odd duck, too? After seeing him eating breakfast while hooked up to a dialysis machine and having a casual conversation…with an empty chair…it seems possible. Later, he sits across the table from a real guy with a real messed up face. While the beating wasn’t courtesy of Ray directly, it is part of his negotiating tactic to get this frightened IT guy to get “the site” back up. But the poor schlub doesn’t know how to do what needs to be done. Ray decides that beating the crap out of him further isn’t going to make him know what he doesn’t. He and his dodgy associate need to find someone who knows how to do this network migration thing. Hmm…who might know who to do that? Elliot scores some Adderall off of Leon in the hopes of deleting Mr. Robot. As soon as he leaves the playground and gobbles down a handful of pills, an SUV screams up beside him and guys (you know, in black) get out, throw a hood over Elliot’s head, and shove him in the back seat. They bring Elliot to an empty warehouse and begin force-feeding him cement. Nightmare. Like, literally. Or figuratively. It’s hard to tell if this is really happening or if it’s the handiwork of Mr. Robot. Because then suddenly Elliot’s on the floor of his bedroom, his fingers down his throat, vomiting up all the pills while Mr. Robot watches. Mr. Robot says he owns Elliot… but not so fast. Elliot rummages through his vomit for the pills and swallows them down again. “I will not be owned.” Fast-forward to three days later and Elliot hasn’t gotten a wink of sleep but hey! Mr. Robot’s gone! Elliot’s elated. He’s more focused now. He’s able to talk to people. Leon’s inane Seinfeld conversations are now fascinating. Pick-up basketball games are great! So is church group and God! The fun only lasts for so long until Elliot realizes he can’t recover from his internal fatal error. He runs out of pills and crashes hard. He can’t avoid the guilt over Gideon’s death…or Mr. Robot. Ray comes into the diner with Elliot’s journal that Elliot dumped after his crazed episode at the church group. Ray confesses that he talks to his wife who died suddenly five years ago over breakfast every day (ah! got it), so they’re more alike than Elliot thinks. Elliot resists Ray’s outreach at first but soon finds himself at Ray’s house asking for advice. Ray’s philosophy is that “control is about as a real as a unicorn taking a leak at the end of a double rainbow.” Ray knows from Elliot’s journal that Elliot sees someone who has taken over his memories. Sensing that Elliot is about to bolt, Ray goes to get the chess board, revealing Mr. Robot behind him. Elliot sits back down. He wonders if maybe Ray is right. “Maybe we’re all just stumbling from the right questions to the wrong answers. Or from the right answers to the wrong questions.” Whichever way it works, as long as Elliot keeps stumbling forward, we’re going to stumble right along with him.",

    "episodeSynopsis": "It’s always good to have dreams…unless you’re one of the characters in Mr. Robot. Because no matter how ambitious (Angela), how optimistic (Elliot -- yes, really) or how determined (Darlene) you are, there’s always someone (Phillip Price, Mr. Robot, or the Dark Army) lurking in the shadows, ready to snatch those dreams out of your clutches and smash them on the pavement. Here’s how those dreams got dashed in episode 203 of Mr. Robot. Through a flashback, we get another glimpse into the seeds of the revolution: Darlene bringing Elliot a mustachioed mask that appeared in their favorite campy horror flick (the aptly titled The Careful Massacre of the Bourgeoisie) on Halloween, Elliot filling in the blanks as to why he was ordered by the court to start therapy for anger management and Elliot relaying his vision to take down Evil Corp. Or was Mr. Robot inhabiting him even back then, carefully orchestrating Elliot’s eventual future? But in the present, Darlene visits Elliot at their mother’s house, trying to convince him to get back into the fight, and reminding him that even before they began, he knew the hard part would be the “after.” But Elliot says all that piss and vinegar came from “him,” which prompts Darlene to say that maybe what she needs right now is “him” -- a perfectly crafted dagger to her brother’s fragile heart. Meanwhile Dom has the FBI crawling all over the arcade in Coney Island. She plays out for her colleagues (and us) what led her there. She found it curious that Romero only printed out a few pages of the FBI roster but then she figured out that each page had a name, including hers, of agents from the New York office who had interviewed Gideon Goddard, though she still doesn’t know what all that means. However, in her mind, all signs point to the arcade being the place where fsociety initiated the hack. Her colleagues Santiago and Jesse are still not buying her line of reasoning until she shows them her prize piece of evidence that the investigators found tucked behind the Mallard Murder game: a shell casing. Joanna’s getting desperate. She’s running out of hush money to keep Kareem, the parking attendant from season one, quiet because E Corp still hasn’t released Tyrell’s severance package. Sutherland, her bodyguard, tells her it isn’t the FBI that’s to blame for the holdup. So she pays a surprise visit to Scott Knowles. How far do you think she gets barking up that tree? Nowheresville. Even after she offers to testify that she went home alone after the fateful party, Scott can’t get past his anger that he doesn’t have Tyrell Wellick’s head on a stick in his living room for murdering Mrs. Knowles to do anything to help Joanna or her baby. Angela meets with Antara. It turns out that Angela had handed off the CD Phillip gave her to Antara yesterday and today Antara had them were arrested. This just proves Angela’s new theory. She thinks that the reason Antara’s attorneys haven’t found anything suspicious in the Washington Township settlement negotiations is because there’s something missing -- and that missing link is Angela, which means that Phillip is trying to negotiate with her. Antara thinks that Angela may be delusional but whatever. Maybe Angela’s right. Later, Angela hits up Phillip as he’s leaving work with demands for an executive office and a major promotion. She claims to have found a pattern in the settlements drafts for the Washington Township suit -- on a seemingly small point that they wouldn’t budge on when they gave up on other larger points. She tells him she’ll agree to get the class to remove the contingency that a third-party company must perform inspections on the Washington Township plant if he meets her demands. But the Master of the Universe tells her this is all in her head, swiftly crushing what he calls “her dreams” under his heel before getting in his car. Whiterose and Phillip Price are in cahoots! But Whiterose is annoyed. Phillip is playing another one of his famous long games with Angela, but Whiterose says, “time is of the essence” and “shutting down the plant is not an option.” Phillip replies by saying he didn’t start this game, Whiterose did, and “Rome may have burned in a day but it wasn’t built in one.” Which of course prompts Whiterose to hang up on him, because the last thing you tell Whiterose is that she’s being impatient. She says to her assistant that it seems like Phillip is opting for his Ecoin strategy so she wants to look into their stage-two schedule. Then the assistant shows her the latest confidential intelligence about the FBI’s discovery of the arcade. She tells him to stay on it -- she wants to know what they know. Elliot concedes to a chess game with Ray but Elliot isn’t as good as he should be, so Ray suggests that he play himself to practice. Ray can tell Elliot is burdened by his thoughts and encourages Elliot to confess to Ray to relieve himself. Elliot ponders telling him the whole truth but Mr. Robot appears and argues against it because confessing won’t stop or save Darlene and will only hurt Elliot. But Elliot isn’t convinced. So Mr. Robot challenges Elliot to a chess game. If Elliot wins, he can confess and Mr. Robot will go away forever. But if Mr. Robot wins, he gets to be in charge of Elliot forever. Eventually, Elliot decides he wants to fight for the world he dreams of, filled with friends and family. So he agrees to Mr. Robot’s chess challenge. But even after three games, they keep hitting a stalemate, the odds of which are impossible. Elliot suddenly realizes he can’t beat Mr. Robot -- ever. They will always be at this impasse, because he can’t beat himself, which of course Mr. Robot knew all along. Cisco surreptitiously intercepts Darlene on the street and tells her to meet him at nearby dive bar. He warns her that the FBI found her arcade and that she’s probably being followed. She asks if this is all the Dark Army’s doing but Cisco says it isn’t, as far as he can tell. He insists that she tells Elliot about Romero, no matter what kind of fragile state he’s in. Even a coital interlude propped against the bathroom sink doesn’t soften the final blow: Cisco’s contacts have told him that Romero was researching the FBI when he got killed and the Dark Army is nervous that someone flipped. She doesn’t believe it but he says that Romero had a printout of a roster of FBI agents attached to something called Operation Berenstain, something top secret with heavy surveillance. Her first impulse is to skip town but Cisco says that would be worse. Darlene calls Elliot and tells him she’s in dire straits through their code word, Init 1, the first command he ever taught her when her computer kept crashing. She needs his help now -- it’s become a matter of life or death…for all of them. Elliot returns to Ray’s house with the chessboard. Ray asks who won. “No one,” Elliot replies. Ray doesn’t seem surprised by that outcome. Then Elliot tells Ray he’s there to help him with his computer problem. Elliot settles himself in the chair in front of the computer as Lonestar, Ray’s heavy, comes into the room at Ray’s behest, to reinforce the need for discretion. After Ray leaves, Elliot opens an IRC window and logs in to chat with Darlene. She tells him everything Cisco relayed to her as Mr. Robot looks over his shoulder. Mr. Robot asks what he’s doing. With the glow of the screen bathing his face like a warm embrace, Elliot replies, “I’m hacking the FBI.”",

    "episodeSynopsis": "Look or don’t look. That’s the dilemma in this week’s episode of Mr. Robot. In Angela’s case, she didn’t want to look at her vulnerability, but there it was in the form of her ex, Ollie. For Elliot, it was looking at what Ray (and frankly, Mr. Robot) told him not to look at that got him into major trouble. So let’s take a look at everything that happened -- hopefully, without any major repercussions for satisfying our own curiosities. With the menacing Lone Star hovering close by, Elliot begins to script out his attack of every Android phone in the FBI building and Evil Corp’s network applications. When Lone Star gets antsy about Elliot’s progress on Ray’s site, Elliot tells him he needs to talk to Ray’s former tech guy RT. Soon a still-bruised RT sits twitching beside Elliot. Elliot can tell RT knows his shit, so why didn’t he do the site migration himself? To find out, Elliot surreptitiously opens up a Notepad window and starts typing questions to RT, who tries to shut him down. Finally RT logs into Ray’s invite-only, hidden site, Midland City, a Craigslist-type black market for every evil on earth, from drugs and weapons to abducted underage girls and hit men. Elliot wasn’t supposed to look and now he can’t un-see it. Does Ray know about all this? Should Elliot hack the site? Alert the authorities? You can guess Mr. Robot’s answers: none of our business, no and no. They have other battles to fight but Elliot can’t let this scourge continue to exist. While the FBI’s forensic investigators crawl all over Steel Mountain trying to find some usable evidence, Dom, Chloe, Santiago, and Vincent head to China to tour their hacked backup sites and meet with the Ministry of State Security, who turns out to be -- wait for it -- Whiterose, dressed as a consummate high-ranking male official named Zhi Zhang. During their meeting, the Deputy Minister of Operations tells the FBI agents that, as they’ll see in their escorted tour of Beijing’s backup facility, their climate control wasn’t attacked like the U.S.’s raspberry pi. Instead, their backup tapes were degaussed (which, by the way, necessitates a giant, heavy, magnet, making that explanation pretty improbable, gauging from Dom’s frown). Here’s where the look/don’t look part comes in for Dom and team: Santiago asks to tour all four backup sites and Dom adds that they’d also like to review all intelligence they have on the Dark Army. Whiterose agrees to both in her signature tight-lipped way, masking her annoyance only slightly. Later at a reception at Whiterose/Zhi’s home to celebrate their “collaborative effort,” Dom and Whiterose wind up (pun intended) sharing a private moment in a room filled with every kind of clock imaginable. She probes Dom about why she became an FBI agent and then she shows her her prized collection of traditional Chinese dresses, claiming they belong to her sister. (Dom later tells Chloe that Zhi doesn’t have a sister.) Whiterose then muses about what life would be like if the Five/Nine hack didn’t happen -- until all the clocks go off at the exact same time and she whisks Dom out of the room. The “looking” in this case doesn’t seem so bad until the next morning, when two masked gunmen storm the hotel lobby where Dom and the agents are staying, spraying bullets everywhere. Everyone but Dom is hit. She grabs a gun from a fallen agent and strikes down one of the attackers, who finishes off the job with his gun to his own head. But there’s still a gunman on the loose… Joanna receives a silver baby rattle in an unmarked envelope through the mail, but Sutherland doesn’t have much luck tracking the sender. Meanwhile, Kareem is still freaking out because he knows for sure he’s being followed. She tries to convince him that he doesn't need to go to the Feds. But then he breaks their “don’t ask, don’t tell” agreement and asks her why they’re bothering to protect “some kid in a hoodie.” Bad move, Kareem. You’ve just made yourself too much of a liability. So Joanna has Sutherland take out Kareem in what she rationalizes is a humane way: letting him process that he’s about to die and to understand why before taking his life. Yeah, paralyzing the guy then shooting him point blank totally doesn’t make you a ruthless murderer, Joanna. Despite Elliot’s firm position against doing so, Darlene tries to enlist Angela to help with the FBI hack since physical security has become a fortress with the FBI on-site at Evil Corp. All Angela has to do is place a device on the FBI floor of Evil Corp in order to help infiltrate their system. Darlene uses the fact that she knows that Angela is the one who put the CD in the drive at Allsafe as leverage and that if she helps, Darlene and Elliot can erase any evidence the FBI has against Angela and Elliot. But Angela still refuses… until Darlene drops the Ollie bomb. He’s still Angela’s vulnerability. Her paranoia piqued, Angela asks Ollie to meet her for a drink. It doesn’t take Angela long to figure out that Ollie is recording their conversation… for the FBI. That’s pretty much all the motivation Angela needs to agree to Darlene’s mission of mercy. Except first she needs one more thing: for Elliot to explain why he dropped out of her life. He tells her he wanted to be “okay” before he saw her again but he sees his dead father standing behind her right now. Despite his lack of personal progress, he seems to be willing to accept her offer of friendship. Elliot can’t help but say something to Ray about the evil e-commerce on his site. Ray acts like he didn’t fully know what was going on and that he turned a blind eye just enough to be able to live with the morality line he knew he was crossing to make a living. Maybe Elliot was right to tell him instead of hacking his site! Maybe Mr. Robot was wrong! But, um, no. That night, two goons come into Elliot’s bedroom and forcibly drag him out of the house. Lone Star comes up to him and drops RT’s rattail on the ground, with skin from his skull still attached. Ray gets out of the car and says, “I told you not to look.” With that, the goons drag him off camera and proceed to beat the crap out of Elliot as the camera zooms in on RT’s bloody rattail. ",

    "episodeSynopsis": "“Just go with it,” the advice Mr. Robot gives Elliot during an extended hallucinatory sequence, could serve as the theme of this episode, both for the characters and the viewers. From Elliot finding himself in a twisty version of a ‘90s sitcom to Angela sweating out the prep and execution of her part of the FBI hack, this episode of Mr. Robot calls on everyone concerned to suspend disbelief and roll with it from beginning to end. In the wake of getting the crap kicked out of him by Ray’s henchmen, Elliot is stuck in a laugh-tracked ‘90s family sitcom version of his life, co-starring his entire family and guest starring Angela Moss, Tyrell Wellick, Gideon Goddard and Alf. (Because if you’re going to have the equivalent of a ‘90s-themed fever dream, of course Alf needs to be in it.) In this “episode,” the Aldersons are on their annual family road trip. Many inappropriate-for-family-viewing things occur along the way, including holding up a convenience store, Alf running over “Officer” Goddard, and Mrs. Alderson punching Darlene in the face more than once. But the most telling pieces of the sequence surround the “very important businessman” who is bound and gagged in the trunk of the family car. The VIB is none other than Tyrell and, after he tries to hop his way to freedom, Mr. Robot takes a tire iron to Tyrell’s head. Mr. Robot responds to Elliot’s incredulity with, “When the truth is painful, the only remedy is a lie. Cuz too much truth, too much honesty -- that’ll kill ya.” The moral of this very special episode is that Elliot comes to the realization that Mr. Robot has won. Or has Ray won? Because when Elliot awakens bruised and battered in a hospital room, he is forced to listen to another of Ray’s parables that basically conveys the message that Elliot is no longer his own master. He now belongs to Ray. Back on U.S. soil, Santiago, who was safely in his hotel room during the terrorist attack in Beijing, tells Dom that Agent Ramos is recommending that she takes a month of psych leave. But Dom isn’t like, “Cool! Paid vacay!” Instead, she contends that if she’s out for that long, the Dark Army wins. He explains that the Chinese are pointing to a group of violent Uyghur Separatists and, by all reports, the Dark Army are just hackers, not killers. Dom argues that violent separatists would’ve taken more victims. Because of the way the shooters behaved -- the one Dom hit took himself out and the other had her cornered and instead put the gun to his own head as well -- means that the Dark Army carried out the attack in order to disrupt the FBI investigation and leave nothing behind, not to slaughter them. Maybe she has successfully convinced Santiago to let her stay. The Speaker of the House delivers the bad news to Phillip Price that the bailout is not going to happen. Revenge is on the public’s mind for what happened in Beijing. The Speaker can’t advocate borrowing money from them in this climate because he’ll look like a traitor. Even Phillip’s threats and insults hold no sway. After he gets off the phone, he barks at his assistant to keep trying to reach Minister Zhang. Has the Master of the Universe finally been backed into a corner? With the FBI on high alert of the attack, the difficulty level of fsociety’s hack of the FBI has risen exponentially. It also means that, ready or not, they have to execute because the FBI will be vacating the E Corp building the next day. Mobley has been running Angela through her paces to enter the script that will enable the attack non-stop but she’s still not getting it. “You can’t teach someone to hack in one day,” he complains to Darlene and Trenton. But they have no choice. Meanwhile, Cisco isn’t exactly earning the “Most Popular Hacker” award with the Dark Army. They don’t like him making demands for a femtocell on behalf of fsociety. With a scary long needle in his index finger, they remind him where his loyalties lie and that he’s just a “foot solder” who needs to follow orders, not give them. The next morning when Cisco arrives at the Smart House with the femtocell, Angela’s eyes register that she recognizes him, but she plays it off when Darlene questions what’s going on. As lunch hour approaches, Darlene -- dressed like “Susan Jacobs” in a blond wig and white skirt suit -- steals card key access to a strategically positioned hotel room across the street from E Corp from an unsuspecting maid. Over at E Corp, signaled by Darlene at the appointed hour of 11:30, Angela heads to the 23rd floor and strides with purpose across a nearly empty floor to the women’s bathroom. She goes into the last stall and takes out her laptop to execute the script but something isn’t quite working. Mobley walks her through the fix on a three-way call with Darlene. And voila! They’re in. Outside the bathroom, Angela artfully deflects the flirtatious advances followed by suspicious questioning from a young handsome agent and presses on to her next task: plugging in the femtocell at a cubicle on the floor. All seems to be working… until it isn’t: Darlene has lost the Wi-Fi connection. Darlene instructs Angela to get to back her terminal and bring it back up. Angela refuses since she’s already done her part but Darlene explains to her if Angela doesn’t do what she asks then Darlene can’t wipe the security footage of Angela on the 23rd floor. As Darlene walks Angela through the last steps over the phone, Dom suddenly appears at Angela’s desk. Lone Star and his goon drag Elliot to Ray’s empty basement, throw him on the floor, and deadbolt the door. A contrite Mr. Robot appears and tells him all he was trying to do was take those punches for him. It looks like Elliot is going to lose it on him but instead, with tears streaming down his face, he says thank you and then hugs Mr. Robot. Yes, hugs. We then go to a flashback of Elliot as a young boy, sporting a shiner in the passenger seat of his dad’s car. Mr. Robot is surprisingly understanding about the incident that occurred at school. His dad then confesses that he has lost his job and that he’s sick -- but no one knows that, not even his wife, so Elliot must keep the news to himself. But Mr. Robot promises he’s never going to leave Elliot and that he’s going to open his own computer store. Elliot asks if he can work there. Mr. Robot says his son can even name the store -- whatever the first thing that pops into his head will be the name. Elliot closes his eyes and…the episode cuts to black.",

    "episodeSynopsis": "In this pivotal episode of Mr. Robot we begin to see a new Elliot emerging: a stronger Elliot who has made peace with his master/himself. He now seems capable of doing something he never considered -- being a leader -- and then… that surprise turn of an ending bathed in a sea of orange (jumpsuits). Did you see that coming, friend? That’s the last thing Elliot remembers from 5/9. After Elliot begins to revive in Ray’s basement, Mr. Robot finally tells Elliot what happened to Tyrell. Tyrell was ranting about what he did to Scott Knowles’ wife and about them being gods, which made Mr. Robot think it was either Wellick or them. So he went for the gun hidden in the popcorn machine… and shot him. But Elliot knows exactly what Mr. Robot’s confession means: if Mr. Robot shot Wellick then Elliot did. Having this new knowledge seems to give Elliot the confidence to do what needs to be done with Ray and his evil-for-sale site. When Lone Star dumps him back in front of the computer, Elliot finishes the migration and gets the site back up -- but also makes the site public and registers it with search engines. After an anonymous tip to the FBI, it isn’t long before the agency has surrounded Ray’s house. But not before Elliot and Ray get to play one last chess game. Ray makes his own confession about how the site was his wife’s brainchild and how he now sees the light about letting it get out of hand thanks to Elliot -- which is the opposite of how he thought it was going to go down when he first met the hooded one. A criminal with a conscience until the end! It now seems as if this is Elliot and Mr. Robot’s chance to start again. Elliot has made peace with his shadow companion and, while he doesn’t want to be the leader that Mr. Robot says Elliot naturally is, Elliot realizes that maybe it’s time to own that mantle and move forward. Angela makes a couple of good ones of her own… and since it’s Affirmation Angela, maybe one big bad one. Good moves: deflecting Dom’s suspicions after Dom spots her on the FBI floor and keeping her hands clean in her part of the FBI hack so Dom can’t pin the responsibility on her (yet? To be determined.). Also: Putting it all together after seeing Cisco at the Smart House and finally getting to tell Darlene that she isn’t as stupid as she and Elliot always clearly thought. In the wait-and-see category: Angela steamrolling a majority of the class to drop the contingency of independent inspections in the Washington Township case so she can use that sway as a bargaining chip with Phillip Price. (We already know her father didn’t consider it a good move for her, him, or the families involved.) What might tip this one toward a not-so-good move is that according to Phillip, Angela has squandered her newfound capital on asking for a lateral move to the Risk Management department where her new boss is hell-bent on keeping her down. Giving her access to the Washington Township case file? Fat chance. But we’re not ready to write off this move -- or her -- just yet. It’s unclear what the group is planning to do with their new power over the FBI beyond wiping Angela from the Evil Corp security footage and executing another Wall Street Bull-related prank. But it’s probably going to be something real good. While Joanna admits that she can’t be the girlfriend that Derek wants (i.e. the kind that has kinky sex with him and then attends his 30th birthday party and meets all his cater-waiter friends), she claims to love him and want the same things as he does. As proof, she produces her divorce summons as a birthday present. All this after a sentimental flashback to when Tyrell was just starting his ascent at Evil Corp and presented her with very expensive earrings… so who knows? OK, so, wow. It turns out that Elliot’s carefully constructed world is a total and complete figment of his imagination, an elaborate fantasy to shield himself from the fact that he’s been in prison this whole time. He hasn’t been living at his mother’s house; he’s been in a jail cell. His sessions with Krista? Real but taking place at the prison, not in her office. Church group? At prison with his fellow inmates. The Seinfeld-obsessed Leon? His prison bestie. The playground and the basketball court? All in the prison yard. “Fantasy is sometimes an easy way to give meaning to the world.” Or to keep us on our toes! Now that Elliot is about to be released, anything’s possible. After all, it’s the journey, not the destination. And what a journey it’s been so far.",
    "titleExplanation": "This could actually be one of two things: the open-source SmartEncryptor, or the propriety Samsung encryption used for archiving text messages. You’ll forgive us if we’re not quite sure, considering this is the episode we discover Elliot has been in jail, not at his mom’s house. He’s been corrupting his own memories, archiving and encrypting them both, for recovery later. The root, “handshake,” refers to the automated process of communication between a computer or server and the devices connected to it. But Elliot is also offering us (the audience) a handshake deal as well –- not to lie to us anymore.",

    "episodeSynopsis": "Probably the best way to sum up this episode of Mr. Robot: s**t has gotten epically real for the fsociety members. Darlene crosses over to the dark side a little more easily than even she thought she could; everyone now sees that Mobley’s paranoia is absolutely founded; Trenton realizes her noble intentions have come at a grave price; and Cisco’s nasty habit of playing both sides against the middle finally catches up with him. fsociety is clearly done with the practical jokes and symbolic spectacles. They finally make the most of their access to the FBI by releasing incriminating portions of an internal conference call about Operation Berenstain in an fsociety video. The public doesn’t seem very psyched that the FBI has been illegally wiretapping 3 million Americans without a warrant since the 5/9 hack as part of the operation. “Tyrannical rape of our data,” the masked Darlene positions it in the video. But fsociety is even less stoked to hear that the FBI had 17-- now 16 -- people around whom they’re building the “code name” case, no matter how strident fsociety’s intention to destroy the FBI and their several corporate accomplices sounded in the video. So it’s like seriously bad timing when Susan Jacobs shows up at her smart house to find the gang sitting in her kitchen. Major ball dropped on tracking her movements, kids. Their temporary plan of restraining the E Corp exec in the poolroom fails miserably when Trenton cuts the plastic ties around Susan’s wrists to let her go to the bathroom and their scuffle ends up in Susan hitting her head against the brick wall. Head injury or no, they can’t just bring her to a hospital now that she has ID’d them so they get to work hacking her life to find dirt on her. But Darlene, who apparently has had it in for Susan ever since she saw the trial on the news when they cleared E Corp of all the B.S. they put her family through when she was four and Susan laughed at the verdict, doesn’t exactly abide by the generally accepted rules of blackmail. Darlene reveals what they’ve found (that “Suze” got “hot and heavy” with her presiding judges) but instead of negotiating, Darlene uses a stun gun that sends a now unconscious Susan reeling backward into the pool. Sayonara, Suze. Meanwhile, Dom has a pissy Xander Jones, the finance guy whom Darlene stole the popcorn machine gun from after sleeping with him, in for questioning. She tells him that the microstamp from the shell casing from a “critical location” (the arcade) related to the 5/9 hack shows that it is his gun, which he was in possession of illegally. That shuts him and his lawyer right up. Immunity is on the table in exchange for a name. The question is, did he even know Darlene’s name? Or her real one for that matter? The scene ends before we find out. Angela is on a date with Andre, her hookup from the bar after she snobbily snubbed Antara. Angela is too busy obsessing over the Mr. Robot video to pay attention to his polite chatter. Annoyed, she gets up to get a drink at the bar and runs into a friend of her dad’s. He says it must be hard for her father to watch his only child bow down to those bastards who killed her mother, among other nasty things. Upset by the exchange, she ups the ante on the semi-flirtatious advances of an older guy who watched her sing karaoke and ditches Andre. We later find out that Andre is a forensics agent working for Dom who pursued Angela at Dom’s behest. But Andre is too wounded by being ditched to continue being Dom’s pawn. Back upstairs, Darlene tries to pass off the Susan Jacobs-pool incident as an accident, but everyone is freaked out and doesn’t quite believe her. She tells Mobley and Trenton to go while she and Cisco wipe down the house and figure it out. Mobley is of course ready to hightail it out of town ASAP but Trenton is more reluctant to leave her family -- until she sees that the FBI is casing her family’s house and Mobley gets taken in for questioning by Dom. (As shaky as he is, Mobley doesn't take Dom’s bait to aid her investigation and demands a lawyer. Since Dom doesn’t have any hard evidence, Santiago orders her to let him go before the public goes even more apesh*t on the agency.) Trenton agrees to meet Mobley at the same coffee shop where they first met when Darlene and Elliot was recruiting her but Mobley is two hours late… Meanwhile, Darlene concludes that there’s only one course of action for her and Cisco to take: full wipe-down mode. Which in this case means incinerating Susan’s body at the animal shelter where they got rid of their hardware after the hack. It’s a gruesome task but afterwards Darlene doesn’t feel nearly as bad as she expected she would. What she does wind up feeling bad about is trusting Cisco. After sleeping off the entire nightmare at his house, she discovers that he’s double-crossing her for the Dark Army and that “stage 2” is about to begin since the femtocell backdoor is now in play. When Cisco gets out of the shower, first he sees that she has destroyed his computer. But what he doesn’t see is the baseball bat she’s about to swing at the back of his head.",

    "episodeSynopsis": "The brownouts happening throughout this episode of Mr. Robot are symbolically apt as a way to sum up what’s starting to happen for Elliot, Darlene, Cisco, Angela and even Mr. Robot now that Elliot is out of jail. From the way this episode builds, it seems like everything is about to go haywire…for everyone. Through a flashback we learn what happened to Elliot when he was first arrested. The key takeaways are that 1) he was arrested because Lenny Shannon, a.k.a. Michael, a.k.a. Krista’s creepy ex, reported Elliot for hacking his computer and stealing his dog (poor Flipper), not anything having to do with the 5/9 hack; 2) Elliot pleaded guilty despite his public defender’s counsel otherwise; and 3) even though his sentence was for 18 months, he was let go after 86 days because the 5/9 hack prompted the early release of many non-violent offenders. There’s also a fun “who’s who” from the last several episodes—Ray as the warden, Lone Star as a correctional officer, Magda as another officer, Leon as, well, Leon, but pre-Seinfeld. After Darlene picks up Elliot from jail, she brings him up to speed, including that she hacked her Dark Army contact (a.k.a. Cisco) and came across something called Stage 2, and that Trenton and Mobley are AWOL. Darlene is freaked that the Dark Army is cleaning house but Elliot says that doesn’t make sense because he thinks they’re behind his early release. After a quick stop at a nursing home to visit the real yet much aged and incommunicative Magda, they head to Cisco’s to pressure him to give up his Dark Army contact. He grumbles a lot as usual but caves. This is when Mr. Robot and Elliot begin to experience their own version of a brownout. They both sense something’s off, but Elliot doesn’t have time to figure out why his hallucination-slash-alter-ego feels like he’s “overheating,” or why Elliot keeps seeing Mr. Robot talk to other people. Elliot hacks Xun’s phone but also wants a F2F with Xun. Elliot thinks once they see him, the Dark Army will talk. However, it doesn’t exactly play out that way. At the library, Xun doesn’t seem to give two craps that Elliot’s standing in front of him, even after Elliot demands to know what Stage 2 is. Basically, Xun says nothing and leaves. Whiterose, in the guise of her/his official alter ego, Zhi Zhang, has come to New York to meet with Phillip Price on the down low. They talk about Phillip’s “pet project” that involves a “she” (Angela perhaps?) doing “the right thing in the end.” Phillip says it’s too bad that everything “she’s” done won’t matter. Because the bailout didn’t come through, the federal government will be taking over the Washington Township plant as of Friday because E Corp can’t maintain it anymore. This does not please Whiterose, who apparently has some stake in that not happening. Whiterose says that Phillip’s actions remind her/him of Phillip’s predecessor’s. But Phillip is all too aware that that’s a barely veiled death threat. (In an earlier scene, Whiterose pees on the grave of Lester Moore, the former E Corp head honcho who tried to shut down Whiterose’s “project” and paid the “price,” so to speak, with an untimely plane-related death.) The only way for Whiterose to prevent the feds from taking over the plant, Phillip suggests, is for her/him to get the Chinese government to pony up the bailout money, interest free, no less, so they can look like the benevolent power in the U.S.’s eyes and then Phillip can push their agenda with the President. Phillip has backed Whiterose into a corner and she/he knows it. “I would rather see you lose than win myself,” Phillip says before walking off. Angela has clearly learned a thing or two from hanging around with her hacker friends! She uses Mobley’s Rubber Ducky to hack her new boss’s computer to copy the Washington Township files. She takes them down to D.C. to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and shares the report with a guy named Jeff Gunther. He tells her that if they move forward, then as a whistleblower her anonymity will be guaranteed. Great, she’s game. But as soon as Jeff turns over the matter to his Deputy Director, Willa Phelps, from the Office of Investigation, Angela smells trouble. Director Phelps seems to know a little bit too much about who Angela is. Angela makes tracks before she gets herself locked in an interrogation room only to find Dom waiting for her in her apartment. Dom knows about Angela’s little “field trip” and tells her that she’s got one hand left to play and that’s Dom. While monitoring Xun’s so far trashy but not especially useful conversations, Darlene realizes that uh oh, she doesn’t have the physical VHS tape from her last Mr. Robot video. With an eye roll, Cisco agrees to go look for it at the Smart House. Cisco finds the tape at Susan’s but then hears someone wheezing, like they’re gasping for air. The scene ends before we find out what that’s all about. Meanwhile, back at Cisco’s, Darlene’s ears perk up when she hears Xun telling another guy that he met Elliot, who wanted to know what Stage 2 was. The other voice responds, “What do you mean? Stage 2 was his plan.” Darlene’s eyes practically pop out of her head. Just as the lights flicker from another brownout, someone starts banging on Cisco’s door. Darlene slowly opens it…and more eye popping but no intel on who’s there. Darlene notices that Elliot looks burnt thought it’s Mr. Robot who agrees that he’s not feeling right as Elliot looks on from across the room (another moment of Mr. Robot even-more-than-usual weirdness). As Elliot approaches his place, his voiceover says, “How can I return to normal when the SUV of the man I murdered is parked outside of my apartment?” As he approaches the vehicle, the window rolls down, revealing Joanna. “Hello Ollie,” she says, before we smash to brown, we mean, black.

    "episodeSynopsis": "As the finale approaches, Mr. Robot allows our two favorite pairs of star-crossed lovers -- Elliot and Angela, Darlene and Cisco -- to share some tender moments before it all gets shot to hell (literally, figuratively, the whole shebang) at the end… The episode opens with a flashback of a meeting between Terry Colby, whose book, The Last Honest Man, is about to published, and Phillip Price. Phillip asks his then CTO to pull some strings with an ambassador friend around a UN vote to help pave the way for China to annex the Congo. It may be just an(other) example of Phillip’s unassailable God complex or it could be a clue as to what Phillip and Whiterose have been scheming. Or both. We don’t quite find out why Joanna called Elliot “Ollie” or how Joanna’s version of Ollie dovetails with the Ollie Parker whom Dom tells Santiago about (more about that below). However, we do learn that Joanna knows that Tyrell and Elliot were working together, that Sutherland messed up his job as it related to Elliot, and that Joanna makes Mr. Robot very, very nervous. When Elliot tells her he doesn’t know where Tyrell is, she coerces him with a sexy whisper into tracing the calls she’s been getting from the burner phone she believes Tyrell sent to her. Mr. Robot tries to warn Elliot away from helping this “psycho” but, you know, Joanna whispered in his ear so how could resist? Dom gets called to the Smart House while the FBI is there tearing apart the place upon suspicion that Susan Jacobs has gone missing. Agent Yang sent for Dom because she has made a connection between the Smart House and the DC activists who pulled the prank. The activists were found in Maryland two days ago. A car chase ensued and while most of them were apprehended, one got away. A neighbor three doors down from Susan Jacobs’ place spotted someone who is mentioned in Dom’s code name case with another male getting into a cab. The composite she gets from the neighbor winds up looking an awful lot like Cisco, which looks an awful lot like the composite they got from the testimony of Ollie Parker (did Elliot rat out Cisco as Ollie Parker?). But Santiago won’t give her the time to follow up on this fresh lead. He has to abide by the new agency rules, which require him to put out a “BOLO” through the media right away. To make up for it, Santiago tips off Dom that another agent has tracked down the cab driver, which leads Dom to Cisco’s place. There she finds a picture ID that confirms both the sketches are of Cisco, a.k.a. Francis Shaw. But “Francis” and Darlene are not at his place when Dom arrives because they’re hanging out at the hospital, where Cisco has convinced Darlene to take Vincent, Darlene’s fsociety DC foot soldier, after Cisco found him barely alive at Susan Jacobs’ place. Darlene, as one of America’s Newest Most Wanteds, should’ve listened to her instincts and her cold, cold heart and avoided going to the hospital. And they definitely shouldn’t have stayed there for an hour while she shared a childhood story. Sutherland takes Elliot to a computer store so he can procure the necessary tools to hack Joanna’s mystery burner phone. While there, an unknown call comes through. All Elliot hears is heavy breathing, which, like Joanna, he imagines to be Tyrell. The call freaks out Mr. Robot so much that by the time Elliot and Sutherland get to Elliot’s place, Mr. Robot has disappeared. Which is all the weirder because Mr. Robot has been agitating Elliot to get back to his place since he left jail. What is he afraid that Elliot will find once he hacks the phone? Did Mr. Robot lie about Tyrell? While Elliot does his thing, he gets a message from Angela, who’s using the alias Claudia Kinkaid (we’re not sure if that’s meaningful but there seem to be a lot of aliases coming up in this episode), asking him to meet her. While he waits for his trick to get the source of the blocked call from the carrier, he goes to meet Angela on the subway. On an empty subway car, Angela tells Elliot that she’s going to confess that she planted the femtocell. She is on her way to meet her lawyer now. Angela is not going to implicate him and Darlene but she can’t keep pretending it’s going to go away or that they can beat the system. She also warns him against working with his dad or whatever or whoever he is, which seems to resonate. While they hug goodbye, he kisses her (!!). His voiceover says that he doesn't want to leave her, but he does anyway at the next stop. With tears in her eyes, she looks away. When she looks back, there’s a man and a woman standing before her in what she thought was an empty car. Dom and Santiago have arrived to speak to the nurse who called the tip line after seeing the sketch of Cisco on TV, but Cisco and Darlene are already gone. Santiago thinks they won’t be coming back but Dom pieces together a timeline that leads her to believe that they don’t know Cisco’s sketch is everywhere. They must be planning to come back to check on their friend after the doctors have completed some tests, which means they’re close by… Yep. They’re at a nearby diner. Darlene should’ve trusted her instincts to bolt but once again, Cisco convinces her to pause while they think through their plan. Because just as Dom spots them in the diner window, radios for backup, and then goes inside to talk to and seemingly argue with them, a motorcycle pulls up outside with two guys in helmets. One guy gets off and starts shooting through the window. Everyone inside drops out of our sight. Dom pops back up and manages to hit the shooter. As soon as he hears the police sirens, he shoots himself dead (hello, Dark Army!) as his partner drives off. Dom runs outside, blood that is not her own splattered across her shocked and frustrated face, but the motorcycle is gone.",

    "episodeSynopsis": "Red or purple? Giraffe or seagull? Is the key in the room? Are Darlene and Cisco alive or dead? Is Tyrell a lucid dream or the real deal? Part one of the season_2.0 finale was full of riddles and unanswered questions so let’s get to it… The two strangers from the subway kidnap Angela and take her to a nondescript house in the ‘burbs. There, a little girl -- who uncannily looks like Angela when she was young -- asks Angela a series of nonsensical questions as a huge fish tank drains in the background. Did you guess that since the leaking fish tank was marking how much time Angela had left to complete the odd quiz that the mastermind behind the whole charade was none other than Whiterose? Then you were correct! It was all a test for Angela to see if Whiterose could trust her with the details of her master plan. Angela has been like a bad penny turning up again and again to complicate Whiterose’s dreams of we’re-not-yet-sure-what but Angela surprisingly passed all of Whiterose’s tests. So instead of having her snuffed out, Whiterose enlists the ever-impressionable Angela to help keep her mission on track. So what’s the first thing Angela does as a now true believer? Cut off all ties with Antara, of course. Can’t have those pesky Washington Township victims getting in the way of whatever Whiterose has up her dress sleeve! After the shooting in Lupe’s, Dom is even more convinced that the Dark Army and China are in cahoots and up to something much bigger and more dangerous to national security than even she imagined. Santiago is worried that’s she gone off the handle after yet another traumatic incident in which there were “several innocent deaths” (are Darlene and Cisco among them?). But now that news has broken that China is loaning E Corp two trillion dollars interest free, he grudgingly admits that her conspiracy theory might actually have some merit. But, he advises, they “need to start finding a way to walk in between the mines and not on them.” After getting him to promise that he’ll let her “do the interview,” she goes home and spends some quality time with her computerized bestie, Alexa. Move over Bitcoin! Move over U.S. dollars! Ecoin loans are here! Phillip steamrolls the beleaguered Treasury Secretary into letting E Corp roll out Ecoin loans to get the economy going again and rebuild the banking sector. And if you believe that, we have some swampland down in Florida for you… Elliot wakes up after he doesn't know how long to find Mr. Robot in his apartment, rifling through a stack of mail. Mr. Robot comes upon a takeout menu for Red Wheelbarrow BBQ with a handwritten cipher message on it. His deft decoding reveals a phone number, which Mr. Robot calls. Elliot overhears a computerized voice say that there will be a cab waiting for him on 25th Street and 8th Avenue. Elliot follows Mr. Robot outside but loses him in the crowd. Damn! But wait, he is Mr. Robot so he can just go to the meeting point without him. Whew! And who gets into that cab with Elliot? Tyrell! But Elliot isn’t sure if it’s really Tyrell, another one of Mr. Robot’s tricks or his own lucid dreaming. He starts freaking out on the cab driver, who doesn’t speak much English, to tell him whether or not the driver sees and hear Tyrell, which gets both Elliot and Tyrell (or just Elliot depending on where you land on that riddle) thrown out of the cab. (Guess they’ll have to walk.) Tyrell says that the Dark Army told him Stage 2 is ready. But of course Elliot has no idea what Stage 2 is because he doesn’t remember. “When you see it, you’ll be pleased,” Tyrell reassures him. “It worked, Elliot. It’s up to us now. Let me show you.” And like Humphrey Bogart as Rick and Claude Rains as Louis in Casablanca, they walk off together into the pre-dawn light.",

    "episodeSynopsis": "Well, friend, we’ve reached the end… at least of the second season. We have now seen a more confident, take-charge side of Elliot; learned that Tyrell is in fact alive (and so is Darlene!), and had confirmation that Angela is not to be underestimated. Here’s where we landed: In a flashback to last season, Tyrell is in the backseat of his SUV in Coney Island but with Elliot, not Mr. Robot. Tyrell demands to know the plan but Elliot holds out. So Tyrell threatens to expose Elliot’s “dirty little secret” but Elliot knows that doing so would hurt both of them equally. Then Tyrell tearfully quotes the famous William Carlos Williams poem his father used to recite in English and they bond over not being able to deny both the negative and positive influences of fathers. Continuing where they left off at the end of the previous episode, Tyrell and Elliot enter a nondescript warehouse building. Inside, a Chinese guy in a white lab tech suit (eating takeout from Red Wheelbarrow BBQ, BTW) takes them up to the floor where Tyrell has been working on the plan that Elliot supposedly masterminded, even though he doesn’t remember doing so. E Corp is recreating their database of titles and deeds with paper documents, which are all being moved to the building across the street from over 70 facilities across the country. (How convenient! All in one place!) Once everything is there, they (Tyrell, Whiterose, the Dark Army, Mr. Robot) will hack E Corp’s system and blow the entire building to smithereens, destroying both the servers and the paper documents forever. And Elliot is the one who made it all possible. “This is for us,” Tyrell says proudly. “All of us,” Mr. Robot echoes, suddenly appearing by Elliot’s side. The good news: Darlene is alive. The bad news: Cisco is not. The also-bad news: Darlene is now stuck in an FBI interrogation room with Dom and Santiago. Whenever they ask her a question, she invokes her 5th amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Santiago’s presence doesn’t seem to be helping, so Dom asks for time alone with Darlene. She then trots out all the physical evidence she has: the video equipment and mask from Cisco’s apartment (but no video tape) and the shell casing found in the arcade from Xander Jones’s gun, which he told Dom that Darlene stole. But Darlene isn’t budging. Dom and Santiago confer outside the room. Dom says they’re running out of time and they have to show Darlene that they’re just as smart as she is or they’re never going to gain her trust. Dom pleads with Santiago to give her one more chance to flip her. “I know her because I am her,” Dom says. Joanna shows up at Scott Knowles’ house with a sonogram photo in her hand. With that photo, she was finally able to figure out that he was the one who had been sending her gifts and calling her, not Tyrell. But what she doesn’t know is why. He explains that his marriage was rocky to say the least but the day of his promotion to CTO and the party celebrating the announcement, Sharon tested positive for being pregnant and was surprisingly happy about it, even though she never wanted kids before that. He finally had everything he wanted -- the job, his marriage, a baby on the way -- only to have it all ripped away from him in one fell swoop. He wanted to give her hope and then step on it like had happened to him. She slaps him and calls him pathetic and weak for mourning a woman who screwed her husband after finding out she was pregnant. Enraged, he wrestles her to the ground and wraps his hands around her neck, but that doesn’t stop her from continuing to taunt him. (Because maybe it’s turning her on a teeny bit…?) He punches her in the face several times but then stops abruptly once he realizes what he has done. He calls 911. Afterwards, she goes to Derek’s apartment. When he sees what Scott did to her beautiful face, Derek wants revenge. She says if he’s serious about punishing Scott, then he’ll go to the police and change his story about the night of Scott’s promotion party to implicate Scott in the murder of his wife. As a last-ditch effort to get Darlene on her side, Dom leads her to a conference room. She explains that instead of going in guns blazing, she took the Python Approach, laying in wait until the prey revealed itself. She says that Romero was actually killed by a stray bullet from the neighbor’s place, not murdered by the Dark Army (or so Dom claims), but that sent “her prey” scurrying. Then Dom shows her a huge diagram laid out on a whiteboard on the wall. There, every fsociety member, including Darlene, as well as Allsafe employees (poor Gideon), Cisco and the Dark Army are connected with intersecting lines. In the middle are the two top conduits: Elliot and Tyrell. Darlene’s response is exactly as we’d expect -- “You’ve gotta be %&*$ing kidding me” -- but to which part she’s reacting, we won't know until next season. Elliot and Mr. Robot get into it once again until he realizes that Mr. Robot is trying to distract him from what Tyrell is doing, i.e. hacking the firmware at his computer, like he and Elliot supposedly discussed. Elliot says they never talked about killing people and leveling a building. He pushes Tyrell out of the way and starts trying to delete the malware. Both Tyrell and Mr. Robot urge Elliot to stop -- Tyrell because Elliot is trying to destroy their destiny and Mr. Robot because he knows Tyrell is dangerous -- but Elliot won’t back down. With tears in his eyes, Tyrell pulls out a gun and points it at Elliot. Elliot is convinced that this is just another one of Mr. Robot’s mind tricks. He’s the only one who exists and it’s finally time to take back real control. When Tyrell fires, Elliot is shocked to see his own blood on his hands. After a trippy dream sequence with the words “Wake Up” appearing everywhere and everyone looking like Mr. Robot, Elliot collapses on the floor of the warehouse. Tyrell says when Elliot gave him the gun, he told him to use it to stop anyone who got in the way of their plan. “I didn’t know what you meant, but now it’s very clear,” Tyrell says. “You did this to yourself, Elliot. Sorry kiddo. I couldn’t let anything get in the way. Including us.” Angela’s phone rings. She knows it’s Tyrell, because “they” told her he’d be calling. She asks if he’s with Elliot. He can barely answer through his tears. She tells him she’s on her way and to not let anyone near him because she should be the first person Elliot sees when he wakes up. She says Tyrell did what needed to be done. Tyrell chokes out that he loves him. “I do, too,” she replies. Hopefully you kept watching past the credits because there’s an extra scene at the end with Trenton and Mobley! They’re alive and miserable in Phoenix, working at a crappy Micro Center. While they’re on break at a picnic table outside of the store, she insists that he look at what she found but he says that he’s taken enough risks for a lifetime and tells her to change the subject. But what if they could get the key and it’s real? she asks. They could potentially undo the whole thing and put everything back the way it was. Then someone walks up to them to ask the time. That someone is Leon.",

    "episodeSynopsis": "In the third season premiere of Mr. Robot, the mirror really starts to have two faces for Elliot, Tyrell is contrite (and still hyperventilating a little), Darlene is dubious, and Angela is as cool as a cucumber. Plus, new character alert! Is Irving a used car salesman or a Whiterose operative? Possibly both. But there’s no doubt he’s the guy who Tyrell calls after shooting Elliot with the popcorn machine gun (at the end of last season) to stop him from messing with Stage 2. Irving calmly assesses the bloody situation and arranges for doctors to save Elliot. Everything’s going to be okay, Tyrell -- just stop pushing down on Elliot’s stomach. Meanwhile, over at the ECorp Power Plant in Washington Township, Minister Zhang is not happy about this messy, unexpected development. Despite his displeasure, he tells his assistant that he wants to let Elliot carry out Stage 2, which his father (unknowingly) helped lay the groundwork for when he was alive. For now, Elliot must be their “guide” because he’s got the “unadulterated, focused rage” to see it through. But after he completes his “great work,” Minister Z says Elliot will suffer the same fate as his father. When Elliot wakes up a week later in Angela’s bed (though not with Angela), the electricity is still out and he doesn’t know how he got there. Angela tells him a man brought him to her place the day before, but she doesn’t know who he is. Since calling the cops is not an option, Elliot needs to find Tyrell to stop him from blowing up Evil Corp’s Recovery facility, a.k.a. Stage 2. Wearing an embarrassing sweatshirt that Angela loans him (no offense, J-Grob), Elliot stumbles over to Confictura but the place has been wiped down and there’s no sign of Tyrell or Mr. Robot. Elliot heads for his apartment, where Darlene has been waiting for him. She’s twitchier than usual -- she almost died right along with Cisco and the FBI took her in immediately following the shooting. She demands to know what Stage 2 is, because guess what, Elliot? She’s heard of it. Elliot finally gives her the lowdown, but man, she’s not happy that he’s been planning this all along behind her back, no matter how adamant he is that it wasn’t him. He realizes he can stop it by closing the backdoor (no, really) created by the femtocell she had Angela install. He just needs a working Internet connection… Back in his signature black hoodie, Elliot and Darlene head over to a raucous hacker space. To free up a computer, Elliot helps them win their round in an international “Capture the Flag” tournament, while Darlene nervously looks over her shoulder at two suspicious guys who are clocking their every move. She goes to her favorite place to have a freak out, the bathroom, and then calls someone (we don’t know who) for help because the Dark Army is there -- with guns. When she returns to Elliot, the two guys approach them and march them outside, instructing them to walk down a separate alley where they are picked up by Irving, who’s apparently a taxi driver, too! Not really, but he sure knows how to stop the FBI from tailing them while deftly handling New York traffic. Irving takes them to the newly opened Red Wheelbarrow BBQ, which makes Elliot think that Irving must be the guy who sent him the menu with the code. Once Irving hears what Elliot is up to, he says their “employer will be disappointed” but hey, if Elliot wants to kill Stage 2, consider it killed. Skeptical that it could be as simple as that, Elliot wants confirmation from “her” but Irving cautions him to quit while he’s still ahead. Darlene, of course, doesn’t buy that they would let this go so easily, even if Elliot closed their access. Realizing that Darlene is probably right not to trust them, Elliot returns to Angela’s and asks her to get him a job at Evil Corp so he can figure out a way to fix all of this. His other request is that she lets Elliot know if he is ever “him” (meaning Mr. Robot) -- because she’s the only one who can tell. He kisses her but she pulls away, reverting to what he calls her “Power Saver Mode” because she can’t love those who love her, only those who don’t. She then says that there’s a way to make it like none of this ever happened, including what happened to their parents, not just Five/Nine, but she doesn't say how. Upon her request, he stays the night.  Angela awakens to see Mr. Robot standing by the window and we learn that managing Elliot in order to coax back Mr. Robot was her plan -- and her assignment -- all along. Sure, they have to figure out how to get back onto the network and continue to redirect Elliot so he doesn’t slow them down, but she’s confident that she has it under control. And if that doesn’t work, she tells Mr. Robot, the syringe she puts in her pocket “in case Elliot comes back” ought to do the trick.Mr. Robot and Angela head out to meet Irving at the subterranean entrance to the new location of Confictura. Angela tries to reassure Irving that Elliot is safely gone but Irving thinks there’s something fishy about all this. Once they get inside, a shaky Tyrell apologizes for shooting Elliot, even though he was doing what Mr. Robot instructed him to do. Then it’s time for Mr. Robot to get back to work.  On the bus ride home, Mr. Robot presses Angela to find out what’s in it for her because he doesn’t really trust her. She wants the same thing as Mr. Robot, and whiterose helped her see that she had a way to bring about justice for her mother’s death. Now that Angela has seen the light, the power starts to flicker back on all across the hobbled city.",

    "episodeSynopsis": "Messed up something in your life, big or small? Just hit “undo!” That’s the magical notion Elliot’s currently operating under, while Darlene attempts to undo her part in the growing crisis in a much different way, and Joanna’s scheme is undone by her forsaken lover. Let the undoing begin! Elliot is now a proud and productive employee of Evil Corp, with a little help from his new friend Zoloft and a fresh batch of a button-down-shirt-of-the-month club. His goal is to “undo” “the fatal exception error of his ways” and fix the world he broke. While he works his way up the corporate ladder, pitching his idea for how to restore and protect Evil Corp’s backup data systems, he hacks the shipping management console to prevent all the paper records from arriving at the New York facility. For good measure, he starts cleaning house, ridding the company of lower-level wrongdoers. Just like the good old days of his vigilante hacktivism! But, after the initial high wears off, he admits that he hasn’t fixed everything. His loneliness is still paralyzing. In Krista’s new home office, he shares with her the story of his father pushing him out the window and breaking his arm when he was a kid. Although oddly, she claims this is the first time she’s hearing about that incident while he could’ve sworn he has told her before. Hmm.Joanna goes on the talk show circuit to corroborate the breaking news: while beating Joanna, Scott Knowles confessed to killing his own wife, which in turn cleared the still missing Tyrell of murder charges. She vows on national television that Tyrell continues to be the one and only love of her life, despite her misguidedly filing for divorce a few months ago. Bartender/boyfriend/fall guy Derek is none too happy that he was just a pawn in her wicked game. When Sutherland spots Derek tailing their car, the Wellicks’ right-hand man punches Derek in the gut and threatens his life if he retracts his statement supporting Joanna’s claim or ever comes near her again. But Derek is not so easily deterred: he approaches their SUV with a gun and shoots Sutherland – but not fatally. Just as Joanna’s reaching for Sutherland’s gun, Derek pops one square into her forehead – fatally -- as her baby screams beside her. Sutherland rallies to fire off one last shot, finishing off the foolish bartender.  It’s official: Darlene is now a CHS (“Confidential Human Source”) working for Dom and Santiago in exchange for immunity. Her one job, which apparently she hasn’t been doing so well for the last six weeks, is to get intel on Tyrell, the “most wanted man in the world,” from Elliot. Darlene claims that Elliot is not working with Tyrell, but a recording of a call from Elliot while he was in prison to Tyrell that they play for her proves the contrary. Despite Darlene’s unreliability, Dom believes Darlene’s theory that the Dark Army has taken over fsociety’s Vimeo account and are responsible for the latest video threatening another imminent attack on E Corp. So when Joanna and Derek appear at the morgue and Sutherland’s in the ICU, Santiago says that they can’t risk releasing the news of Joanna’s death because they have to find Tyrell before it’s too late. Looks like that poor baby is off to social services. Later that day, which happens to be Elliot’s birthday, Elliot agrees to meet Darlene in Coney Island even though he believes she’s a trigger in bringing out Mr. Robot. She tells him she’s leaving town first thing in the morning. Because he’s been feeling wistful for simpler times, he asks her to sleep at his place to keep him company. Before dawn, however, Mr. Robot appears, catching Darlene doing something suspicious around his computer. After he handles her roughly, she shakes him off and flees.At the G20 summit, Phillip Price calls out China for being the only holdout to not sign the Five/Nine Economic Accord to make Ecoin the world’s primary currency, claiming that by doing so, they are declaring a currency war. Later, in a private meeting, Price demands that Zhang have his government sign the accord if they want the UN to vote to annex the Congo in 11 days. Zhang reminds Price that “your success will always follow mine,” so until he gets his UN vote, Price shouldn’t waste his time. When Price threatens the vote altogether, Zhang reveals his ace in the hole: his discovery of Price’s pet employee, Angela, whom he could’ve easily killed. After the meeting, Zhang tells his assistant that he wants Stage 2 implemented no matter what, as opposed to it only being done if Price doesn’t come through. That’s a pretty big hand slap. At his next therapy session, Elliot asks Krista to “talk” to Mr. Robot. When Mr. Robot appears, he menacingly tells Krista she needs to back off so that he and Elliot can finish their work, not that it matters anyway since he knows that Darlene has compromised them. When Elliot returns to the surface, he starts freaking out about what Mr. Robot said about being compromised. Is Stage 2 still on even though Elliot did everything he could to stop it? He rushes home. Lenny, Krista’s ex boyfriend who had Elliot put in jail for hacking him, is at Elliot’s door with the supposedly sick Flipper, who Lenny no longer wants, so Elliot takes the dog back. Once inside, he starts running a scan on his computer. It doesn’t take long for Elliot to figure out that Darlene put surveillance on his computer. The next morning, on the security monitors of the FBI safe house, Dom and her tech guy see a figure wearing a hoodie enter the house: Elliot",

    "episodeSynopsis": "This one’s All About Tyrell. Where was Tyrell while Elliot was living in a world of his own making in prison? Answered. What was he doing? Answered. What did he look like while he was in hiding? Really answered. Friends, say hello to “Farmhouse Tyrell.” As an added bonus, another big reveal. Guess who else is on the Dark Army’s payroll? We return to the fsociety arcade on the night of the Five/Nine Hack, Tyrell watching in awe as Elliot’s code works its magic on Evil Corp. Elliot retrieves the gun out of the now-famous popcorn machine and trains it on Tyrell, but who pulls the trigger? Mr. Robot, just as he said he did. But -- and this is a big but -- the gun malfunctions…or does it? Tyrell takes this as proof that they are both gods who have an “uncanny bond,” almost using the L-word (!). Mr. Robot isn’t as convinced of the meant-to-be-ness of it all, until he realizes that Tyrell is the “perfect kind of crazy who can protect me from me” and by doing so, allow them to finish off Evil Corp, together. Aw. Bromance. Why did Tyrell suddenly become the most wanted man in the world? Being suspected of killing your new boss’s wife doesn’t get you there. The real reason: An E Corp IT guy, James, who completed the honey pot request, ratted out Tyrell to Gideon Goddard, who in turn called the FBI. So back in the arcade, none other than our new favorite fixer, Irving, arrives at the behest of their “mutual friend,” flanked by two masked Dark Army heavies, to clean up the mess. Irving instructs Elliot to drive Tyrell’s SUV to a parking lot and then go home and lie low while Tyrell goes into hiding. Irving takes Tyrell to a remote farmhouse in New Jersey, that’s tricked out with a serious security system and tons of acreage, but not much else, and leaves him there alone, phoneless and computerless, to await further instructions. One night, Tyrell is awoken by visitors: two Dark Army operatives as well as the seemingly unassuming Mr. Williams who offers tea but not a lot of sympathy. Fueled by the powdery white substance he continuously snorts, Mr. Williams begins a relentless interrogation of Tyrell, not as puzzle-y and confusing as Angela’s quiz, but equally as intense and repetitive, until Tyrell cracks, reversing all of his previous answers. The big confessions: Yes, he killed Sharon Knowles and no, he won’t be loyal to “me” (Whiterose). However, he says, he will always be loyal to Elliot. That seems to be the magic answer. After Mr. Williams gets the nod from Whiterose’s assistant, who has been lurking in another room, he tells Tyrell he can now get started on “Red Wheelbarrow,” which they’re calling Stage 2 at “Mr. Alderson’s request” (which Mr. Alderson would that be?) at the farmhouse until they can establish a more permanent headquarters. He also finally tells Tyrell where Elliot is. When they give Tyrell a new phone, he gets a call from the prison. Bonsoir, Elliot. But life on the farm isn’t all bucolic and relaxing. While Tyrell preps Stage 2, he obsesses about his baby and his wife. To blow off steam, Irving turns him onto chopping wood. At the same time this is going on, on Zhang’s private island, his assistant reports that Elliot immediately pleaded guilty and was sentenced for 8 months, which happened too quickly for them to intercept the proceedings. Zhang instructs his assistant to have their operative inside the prison greet Elliot and also take a look at which officials are on their payroll to help with an early release plan. Zhang’s next appointment is none other than Frank Cody, the conspiracy theorist and host of “Let’s Be Frank.” Who isn’t on the Dark Army payroll? (Wait for it….) Zhang gives Frank three assignments: 1) to start an “image rehabilitation” on Tyrell since he’s going to be blamed for the Five/Nine Hack; 2) to put fsociety’s origin on Iranian soil; and 3) to back Trump as the presidential candidate. We get a brief glimpse of Cisco in this flashback episode, showing when Darlene gave him the femtocell. Who did he bring it to? Xun, his Dark Army conduit. But whose car was Xun sitting in? Irving’s. Irving then tells Cisco what we now know to be true: if anything gets messed up, Darlene’s protected but Cisco’s not. Poor Cisco. All he wanted to do was go to Budapest on a vacay with Darlene. As Tyrell’s hair and beard grow longer and more uncharacteristically unkempt, cleverly showing us the passage of time, he notices additional Android malware code that doesn’t have to do with their plan and gets suspicious. Fed up, he packs his devices and hightails it through the woods. But a local cop spots Tyrell and after a short chase, catches him and throws him in the back of his cop car, handcuffed, while the cop fantasizes about the rewards he’s about to reap for catching The Most Wanted Man in the World. While the cop and Tyrell await the arrival of the feds in an empty field, Tyrell tries to dislocate his finger to shimmy his hand out of the cuffs. An SUV pulls up and the driver shoots the cop in the head. When the shooter points the gun on a shaken Tyrell cowering in the back seat, we learn that it’s… Santiago! (Ever wonder why Santiago wasn’t shot in China?) With Tyrell delivered unharmed back to the farmhouse, Santiago tells Irving that he’s pissed that he was put in the position of killing a cop to clean up Irving’s mess since he’s already feeling vulnerable about his cover with the FBI. After Santiago leaves, Irving faux-relates to Tyrell to get him back on the Stage 2 Train. After checking the status of Elliot’s release with Leon in prison, Irving shares the good news with Tyrell. They head back into the city so Tyrell can confirm that Confictura HQ has been created to his specifications. Irving takes him to a Dark Army hotel to shave all that facial hair and await his instructions to rendezvous with Elliot. Oh, and by the way, Irving tells Tyrell that his popcorn gun really was broken, that’s why the shot Elliot/Mr. Robot took didn’t kill him. So much for being gods! To finish our “Where in the Heck in the World Was Tyrell Wellick?” episode, we cut to the aftermath of Tyrell having shot Elliot at Confictura. While Elliot’s being operated on by Dark Army surgeons, Angela comforts Tyrell, who is upset because when they finally reunited, it didn’t feel so good. Why didn’t Elliot believe Tyrell was real? Why did he seem like a different person? Angela sighs and explains the answer to that riddle. After the surgery is over, the person in the hospital bed staring at Tyrell is not Elliot: it’s Mr. Robot. ",

    "episodeSynopsis": "This brother and sister sure do have a complicated relationship. Add the fact that the brother is sort of two people and “it’s complicated” goes off the charts, as we see in this episode. For Tyrell, the bloom seems to be off the rose when it comes to his precious Elliot, while Angela is turning into a whiterose mini-me. Let’s do a deeper dive into the story behind this week’s data. Darlene awakens in a subway car to find her wallet is stolen and deduces that of the few people around her, a lilac-haired girl impatiently waiting by the door is, duh, the pickpocket. Darlene gets the girl to produce the wallet but all Darlene wants is the Polaroid photo of we-don’t-know-what that’s in her wallet. We return to the moment that Elliot enters the FBI safe house, but now see that he’s in the downstairs apartment where Darlene has been staying, gathering data on who lives there. Darlene’s purple backpack is a pretty big giveaway. Dom hightails it outside to tip off Darlene before Darlene walks in the door. Putting on a voice protector device, Elliot confronts his sister. Her defense is that she hacked “him,” not Elliot, because she’s afraid of “him.” Elliot asks her to go with him (no quote marks) to his apartment so he can show her something. There, he tells her that she was right: Stage 2 has not been called off and he has the data to prove it. She calls his bluff: he could easily send in an anonymous tip to the FBI with all this information and walk away. But for some reason, he can’t let go. Darlene asks him if he can go back to that place of wanting to stop it and if so, how can they find Tyrell. The plan: Darlene will hide out in Shayla’s empty apartment and when Elliot turns into “Mr. Hyde” at night, she will follow him to Tyrell. At 1:48 am (significant?), Darlene hears Elliot leave his apartment from her hideout across the hall. She follows him outside, where she spies him talking to Angela and eventually taking off with her in a cab. As Irving chomps on some ribs for breakfast (hey, why not?) at Red Wheelbarrow BBQ, he informs Angela that their plan is a go on September 29th, 10 days from now. Angela is concerned about making that timeframe with these shipping delays. Having “our guy” on the inside should help speed things up, right? he counters. She doesn’t argue but wants Irving’s assurances that the building will be evacuated before they execute, but his answer is less than convincing. Before they conclude their staff meeting, she asks Irving if whiterose ever showed him…(what, we don’t know). He says yes. When she asks if he believes in it, he says anything is possible. The FBI knocks down the apartment door of a man we haven’t seen before, but looks like he could be the Iranian “origin” whiterose wanted Frank Cody to put in place for fsociety. After questioning him back at the office, Dom and her new partner from the safe house don’t see eye to eye on this new player, Mr. Nouri, even though he eventually admits that fsociety is his leader. Dom is suspicious of how easy it was to find him, and still believes there’s a connection to the Dark Army and whiterose. But her partner says whiterose is a “boogieman story for the Dark Army.” Although, she wonders, if the Dark Army did put Nouri up to this, it is strange that he didn’t kill himself in lieu of getting caught. At Confictura HQ, Angela tells Tyrell that she figured out that Elliot is responsible for rerouting all the paper records. Tyrell can’t take the back and forth anymore, having Elliot undo everything they’ve been working on for the past six weeks. And on top of that, Angela has agreed to an impossible new timeline! Angela calmly explains her solution: they’ll fly the west coast records to the facility and truck in the east coast ones over the weekend. In the meantime, she’ll get Elliot’s E Corp access revoked. Tyrell is not convinced that plan will work and directs his anger over at Mr. Robot, declaring that he, Tyrell, is in charge now. Mr. Robot does his classic throwing-against-the-wall-by-the-neck move but releases his grip when he starts to short circuit. Elliot reappears long enough to take in the scene until Angela plunges the syringe into him, curtailing Elliot’s return. When Dom and Darlene meet up at a bar, Dom’s pissed because Darlene disappeared again except for sending one text saying that she “may have a development.” Darlene says she’s sick of a being a traitor and a social pariah, so now they’re going to do things her way. She may have a lead but needs to go it alone without a wire. Even if she gets immunity, she knows she’s going to lose her brother, so Dom owes her this. When Tyrell complains to Irving about Elliot and that Angela’s plan to ship paper records from 71 facilities over the weekend will draw too much attention, Irving reminds Tyrell that their boss is strict about her schedule. Seeing that Tyrell needs some stroking to get him over the finish line, Irving gives Tyrell a pep talk, which does the trick. Tyrell gets back on board as long as Irving can meet the following demands: 1) to see his baby, in person; 2) to be sent to the Ukraine, which is safe from U.S. extradition, with his wife and baby on Monday after the plan is complete; 3) the ability to engage the full force of the Dark Army in order to execute (which he doesn’t realize is actually easier to deliver on than that second item). To keep things on track, Angela calls Price directly to get him to fire Elliot and ban his access. With that taken care of, she tells Mr. Robot that he has to stay in her apartment over the weekend to avoid any further mishaps. Then she gets a text from Irving: they’ll be ready to go on Monday. Darlene packs up her stuff from Shayla’s apartment and stops in Elliot’s, where she places the Polaroid -- a photo depicting the Alderson family at Coney Island -- back on his shelf.",

    "episodeSynopsis": "Hold onto your seats, friends, because this episode takes place in one queasy, tension-filled continuous shot on an anything but typical Monday morning at Evil Corp. Elliot tries to reconstruct the days he lost while Mr. Robot was in charge while Angela takes major matters into her own hands. Strap yourselves in for one heck of a rollercoaster ride… Against the backdrop of the UN vote on the annexation of the Congo scheduled for later that morning and an amped-up protest going on outside of Evil Corp’s HQ, Elliot arrives at work, twitchy and unsure of where he’s been for the last three days. After discovering that he’s locked out of his work account, he jumps onto his cube mate Samar’s computer. The bad news: earlier that morning the Dark Army tried to run Stage 2. The good news: his patch stopped them -- for now. Before he can figure out how the Dark Army is working around his patch, HR comes stomping down the hall, flanked by security. Darlene calls a couple of times to get him to meet her outside, but he can’t leave the building yet. His only chance to stop the Dark Army is to get to the 23rd floor and retrieve the HSMs (hardware security modules, yo), which, he quickly discovers, is too hard to do with security on his ass and a deactivated card key. If he can’t the save building, at least he can save the people. He manages to get outside, amidst the din of angry protestors, and calls in a tip to have the records building downtown evacuated immediately, claiming there’s a bomb in the building, which for all intents and purposes is true. Darlene appears beside Elliot and basically blurts out that she’s working with the FBI. He’s hurt and feels betrayed, even if the deal she made was for their immunity in exchange for Tyrell. Sibs are supposed to share this kind of stuff. She tells him that she watched Elliot like he asked and saw “him” sneak out of the apartment and meet up with Angela, who knew Elliot was “him.” Darlene suspects Mr. Robot and Angela have been working with Tyrell. How’s that for betrayal? Elliot suddenly realizes that his “runtime error” was briefly seeing Angela and Tyrell together the other night. Moments later all hell breaks loose when a protestor smashes a bottle over a riot cop’s head, allowing the mob to rush the lobby and wreak anarchist havoc. A few rioters force their way onto the elevator and up to Angela’s floor. While keeping a low profile in her office, she gets a call from Irving, who tells her there’s a package for her at the reception desk on her floor. He explains that the riot is their distraction because there’s been a hiccup in the plan, a.k.a. Elliot’s patch. He needs Angela to get Elliot to make a copy of the HSM on the 23rd floor. The package contains all the hardware and instructions Elliot needs, including an ID to give him special security access. So off Angela goes in search of Elliot…or so we think. Curiously, when Elliot calls her, she dismisses his call. An overzealous security guard almost thwarts her progress to get down to the 23rd floor but realizing that most of the rioters are there to give her cover, she yells out to one of them, who is more than happy to “take care” of the guard to get Angela out from under his thumb. She quickly follows directions to the HSM Server room, locking the doors behind her, protecting her from rogue rioters not on the Dark Army’s payroll, and gets to work following the instructions inside the package. While she frantically searches for a USB dongle in the adjoining CSAT room, a woman named Lydia rushes in and slams the door. After sizing up Angela, Lydia doesn’t buy her cover story but a rioter scares off Lydia before she can pursue her suspicion any further. Angela completes the task at hand, cloning E Corp’s HSMs to a mobile HSM. Before leaving the relative safety of those rooms, she disguises herself with the fsociety mask and a hoodie of the rioter who was felled by Lydia’s strategic use of pepper spray. As she waits for the elevator, eyes burning from residual pepper spray, someone who looks an awful lot like Elliot darts by in the background… Once she’s on the elevator, she calls Irving to report that the task has been completed but that a woman saw her in the CSAT room. Hold the phone! Why was Angela in the room instead of Elliot?, Irving wants to know. Angela claims that she couldn’t find Elliot amidst the overkill of his “distraction.” Besides, Irving said that he needed it done immediately so she got it done. Interesting…but was she able to follow everything on that sheet of paper? She hesitates but then yes’s him. Alrighty then. Next step: give the package to the deliveryman waiting at reception. Before she hangs up, she asks Irving if the building downtown has been evacuated and he says it’s been done already. (Raise your hand if you believe him.) He just needs Angela to stay strong. After the handoff, she walks back to her office, visibly shaken. Her old friend Elliot is waiting by her door. Is there something she wants to tell him?",

    "episodeSynopsis": "The day ain’t over yet, friends. As Elliot frantically tries to stop Stage 2, Tyrell realizes the Dark Army’s true intentions for him, Dom disobeys orders to follow her (correct) gut instincts, and Minister Zhang serenely sips champagne as if this particular Monday is going to end like any other day. Let’s recap where the chips, and other things, have fallen. In a poignant flashback, we see young Angela during a subdued house party, which we learn is a farewell party for her terminally ill mother. Angela’s mother has decided not to go forward with any more treatment, despite Antara, the lawyer Angela hired to re-try the Washington Township case, telling Mrs. Moss that an anonymous benefactor has offered to pay for the next round. Mr. Alderson, Elliot’s dad, encourages Angela to go speak to her mom. Her mother consoles her daughter by telling her that she believes that there’s another world out there for both of them… Picking up where we left off on that chaotic Monday, when Elliot confronts Angela outside of her office during the riot, he gets no satisfaction. She seems to feel bad but, hey, this is what he wanted. whiterose said this will save the world and change everything for the better. Wait, she met whiterose? WTF! Doesn’t she realize that whiterose is a terrorist? Angela reassures Elliot that everyone will be fine, including his father and her mother. How’s that now? She doesn’t explain and won’t give up Tyrell’s location, but when he sees the Red Wheelbarrow BBQ takeout bag, he puts two and two together because Elliot is smart like that. While Darlene is getting another earful from Dom and her partner at the safe house for going rogue, she gets a call from Elliot. He texted her Tyrell’s address, so she needs to get the FBI there ASAP to stop him. But guess who throws shade on that idea? Double-Agent Santiago. He tells Dom to stand down until they get visual confirmation. After Dom and her partner leave his office, Santiago texts Irving that the location has been burned and they need to “take care” of Wellick. Minister Zhang and Phillip Price clink glasses to their mutual win: the UN vote to annex the Congo to China has passed. Champers all around! However, Price expects China to sign the economic accord so Price has enough dough to fix his wounded E Corp. Zhang smugly assures him it will be done by the end the day. After Price excuses himself, Zhang gets a call from his assistant telling him Wellick’s location has been compromised. Zhang tells him to stay the course. As Dark Army operatives remove the equipment from Confictura, Tyrell asks Irving why they’re not staying to monitor the fallout. And by the way, what time’s his flight? Is the wife and kid meeting him at the airport or…? Irving apologetically informs him that it’s not going to work out the way they discussed. He hands Tyrell instructions and leaves. After reading them, Tyrell sets the piece of paper on fire as Irving instructed, then drops the burning paper into a metal wastebasket, pouring vodka over it to stoke the flames. Then he handcuffs himself to the bed. Instead of sitting around waiting, Dom and her partner decide to go have “lunch” at Red Wheelbarrow. After scoping out the restaurant, she slips into the kitchen, where she sees a worker batting away smoke coming from behind a door. She reports the fire to the FBI Op Center and asks for Santiago to be notified that she has possibly found Tyrell. After kicking down the door, she descends the smoke-filled steps to discover the smoldering trashcan, empty handcuffs locked to a cot and a suit jacket draped over a chair, but, again, no Tyrell. She pushes open a secret door, likely Tyrell’s escape route. Moments later, Santiago and the FBI Evidence Recovery team are on site. Santiago reprimands Dom for disobeying a direct order, however she has gotten them one step closer to Wellick. While the task force canvasses the tunnels looking for Tyrell, he wants her to go back to the office. After leaving E Corp uptown, Elliot hightails it downtown to the Recovery Building to log into that UPS to terminate the “unwanted process,” aka Stage 2. Just as he arrives, the Fire Department is letting the employees back in the building because they didn’t find any bombs. He swipes a security guard’s ID to gain access. But every step forward he makes overwriting the malware and revoking the stolen keys, Mr. Robot literally and figuratively sends Elliot reeling two steps backward. Elliot soon concludes that instead of fighting, it’s time to talk. At first, Mr. Robot is not open to having a rational dialogue through text dialogue boxes -- that is until Elliot tells him that the building doesn’t actually have any paper records in it. So why murder a bunch of innocent people? Bingo! Mr. Robot finally helps him unlock the door Elliot needs to get into to trip the halocarbon fire suppression system, which will make it impossible for a spark to ignite the UPS devices. Elliot has saved the day…or has he? On the plaza outside the FBI office, while Dom sulkily waits in line for coffee, Tyrell rushes into the crowd of cops and agents, begging them to stop the attack. Dom runs over and demands to know what attack. Before he can answer, Tyrell gets handcuffed and taken away. As the employees evacuate the building, Elliot begins to wonder: the Dark Army knew that there were no paper records in the building, so what was whiterose’s real plan? Elliot soon realizes his fatal mistake: 71 Evil Corp buildings have just exploded in a coordinated nationwide attack, with the death toll expected to be well into the thousands. He was so focused on the New York facility that he couldn’t see the bigger picture. The New York building wasn’t the single point of failure, he was.",

    "episodeSynopsis": "In this episode, the Dark Army’s victories continue to mount while Mr. Robot (and by extension Elliot), Tyrell, Trenton, Mobley, Dom -- even Phillip Price -- lose big. A lot happens so let’s get to it. We already knew from the very (and we mean very) end of season_2.0 that the Dark Army had located Trenton and Mobley in Phoenix when Leon appeared, but not when that occurred in the timeline. Now we learn that the timing is that same fateful September Monday. Mobley’s roommate lies dead on the floor, his throat slashed open, while Trenton and Mobley shake with fear on either side of a knife-wielding Leon. Leon reassures them that he’s only there to “babysit,” not kill them. Dumping the body in the trunk of what’s likely a stolen Cadillac, Leon drives his two charges into the desert to dig a grave. Mobley whispers that this must be happening because of the e-mail Trenton sent to the FBI, but she says she never sent it. However, she did set it up to automatically be sent to someone she trusts if she never makes it back to her computer. Even after their attempt to escape fails spectacularly, Leon claims to know nothing about the Dark Army’s plans for them beyond the “immediate future.” Back in NYC immediately after the attacks, Elliot rushes over to Krista’s apartment. Just as he’s about to confess his part in the day’s horrific events, Mr. Robot takes over. In his frustration with how Elliot “ignored his responsibilities,” Mr. Robot blurts out the truth about him being the architect of Five/Nine. However, he and Elliot are not “the real string pullers,” who swiped his ideas to serve their own financial agenda. At first, she dismisses his claim as delusional until he spells out “the math” for her. After he leaves, she calls her lawyer to ask him if she should report Elliot. He reminds her that she’s bound by doctor-patient privilege and that she can’t turn him in unless he stated he’s going to do something in the future. With a new (fake) fsociety video threatening yet another major attack in the next 24 hours, Dom and Santiago hash it out with Tyrell’s lawyer. The lawyer’s position is that the FBI has no hard evidence of his client being anything other than a pawn, but at least he’s one who could lead them to the actual terrorists -- in exchange for protection and immunity. After the meeting, Dom and Santiago are at odds once again. Dom believes they’re being played by the Dark Army and should haul in the whole fsociety crew but Santiago thinks they have nothing to lose by making the deal. Guess who wins that showdown? Over at Angela’s, she flips through the wall-to-wall breaking news broadcasts on TV, numb with shock. Darlene, who had come over to confront her just before the attacks occurred, says she’s going to grab her stuff and come right back. When Darlene returns, Angela replays the collapse of one of the buildings over and over. Even if there are more casualties or explosions, she explains, everything will be fine. See? When she rewinds the video of the collapse to the beginning, all the people come back. At the FBI office, Agent Stanchek reports to Santiago that Wellick ID’d the two suspects, (aka Trenton and Mobley), which was corroborated by Sasan Nouri, their “fsociety video perp” (aka the fall guy hired by Frank Cody for whiterose). Now they can release a BOLO. When Santiago saunters into interrogation room, he turns off the video camera that has been recording Tyrell’s questioning. He proceeds to crush Tyrell with the news that his wife is dead, shot at close range by a spurned lover, and his son is in foster care. If Tyrell is thinking of telling anyone about Santiago or veering from the plan, Santiago promises certain death for Tyrell and an unthinkably awful future for his son. Mr. Robot tracks down Irving at Irving’s Auto Square to register his WTF about the Dark Army going rogue. But before Mr. Robot gets too far, a masked Dark Army operative comes up behind him and knocks him out. When he comes to, Irving has driven him into the city to show him a fancy party taking place on a rooftop, the partygoers undeterred by the day’s tragedy. Irving explains that Elliot and Mr. Robot’s mistake was in thinking that their plan was a revolution, when in fact it was bankrolled by people like those at the party and allowed to happen for a greater purpose. Nothing can stop these “shindigs” -- or the larger plan. Still stuck at Mar-A-Lago after the attacks, Price confronts Zhang in the ballroom. Even with China finally having signed the Ecoin accord, Price says that now nothing will save his company. Zhang disagrees -- Ecoin will help E Corp survive. But as Price begins to realize he himself was never going to survive the latest turn of events, he demands to know why. He always understood that the Five/Nine hack was a temporary global crisis to help Price pressure the administration to allow China to annex the Congo, but then everything went according to plan. Zhang explains that he’s punishing Price for not doing the one job he gave him when he installed him as CEO: protect the plant, which meant controlling Angela and her lawsuit. But the real reason why Zhang needed to destroy so much: to teach Price a lesson because Zhang had to ask him twice. Ouch. Leon returns Trenton and Mobley back to Mobley’s house and into the hands of whiterose’s assistant. The English lessons having clearly paid off, the assistant asks the duo to follow him into the garage and sit down at newly installed workstations. The computers have been set up to look like Trenton and Mobley have been plotting to hack air traffic control at major airports to crash planes. They beg for mercy, but to no avail. Though they have no future use to the Dark Army, their self-sacrifice and everything in the room will now serve an important purpose in telling a “story.” The masked operatives move forward with guns….As Dom, her partner, Santiago, and others in the FBI office watch on monitors from afar, the FBI SWAT team moves in to the house in Phoenix, sweeping every room until finally entering the garage. But the Dark Army remains one step ahead of the FBI: the only people now left in the garage are Trenton and Mobley, on the floor bleeding from what is meant to look like self-inflicted gunshot wounds to their heads. As the SWAT team’s cameras pan around, we see that the garage has been dressed with an Iranian flag alongside an fsociety one, a video camera and an fsociety mask. Santiago tells Dom even though they didn’t get the suspects alive, at least the FBI prevented another attack. Stunned, Dom goes into her war room and crosses out Trenton and Mobley on her whiteboard. She scribbles out a name on a piece of paper and places it above Tyrell’s position at the top of the matrix: whiterose. “You’re actually going to get away with this,” she says, her voice full of defeat and disbelief.",

    "episodeSynopsis": "To delete or not delete, that is the question Elliot is asking himself three weeks after the “71” attacks. The answer ultimately comes from a very surprising source -- and a green lollipop -- so let’s go “Back to the Future” and see how he got there. In a flashback, young Elliot is with his dad at the local movie theater for their usual movie night, but Elliot knows that the situation is anything but usual: his dad is sick, but won’t admit it. Edward Alderson acknowledges that he’s made some mistakes and asks for Elliot’s forgiveness before collapsing on the lobby floor. As an indifferent Elliot picks up his dad’s now infamous jacket and walks down the hall into the movie theater, we see that he’s wearing a sling on his arm, likely a nod to when his father pushed him out the window. Back to present day, Elliot is home, looking at the latest news on Trenton and Mobley online, knowing that everything being reported is a lie. He switches over to a folder where he has five subfolders for Shama Biswas (Trenton’s real name) and for Sunil Markesh (Mobley’s real name), seemingly the contents of their dossiers. He copies their information to CDs before deleting their files from his computer and starting a full wipe-down. Darlene arrives and tells him Angela’s having a full-on breakdown ever since the attacks. But Elliot couldn’t give two hooties about Angela after what she did to him. It becomes clear that he’s still feeling mighty guilty for his part in the attacks, even if it was technically Mr. Robot’s doing, as well as the deaths of two “good people.” After she leaves, Elliot shoves the fried computer hardware and Mr. Robot’s jacket into a garbage bag and dumps it outside. He seems intent on deleting Mr. Robot and by extension, himself. After purchasing an entire pouch of morphine from what seems to be a new drug dealer for Elliot, Hard Andy, Elliot goes to see Sandesh, Mobley’s brother, in the ‘burbs. Elliot is there to pay his respects but Sandesh is irate: thanks to his brother, he’s about to be fired from his law firm. Elliot tells him not to believe the lies about Mobley. Unconvinced, Sandesh says there’s no way he’s going to pay for a “terrorist’s funeral.” Elliot’s next stop is Trenton’s family’s house, outside of which her father is nervously packing up their belongings. Claiming that he went to school with Trenton, Elliot tells her father that she was a good person and that she’s innocent. He thanks Elliot for saying nice things about her but he and his family are still leaving. On the beach at Coney Island, Elliot takes out the pouch of “Miss Emma” pills when Mohammed, Trenton’s younger brother, who followed Elliot there, comes up beside him. Mohammed, with his incessant questions, seems to sense something is up with Elliot and won’t leave him be. So the two embark on an odyssey of sorts, with Elliot eventually agreeing to take him to the movies until Mohammed’s parents return from Connecticut. As it happens, it’s October 21, 2015, also known as Back to the Future Day, so the theater is having special screenings of the trilogy while fans watch, cosplaying as their favorite characters. Mohammed would rather see The Martian, but Elliot convinces him that Back to the Future is a much better choice for, like, obvious reasons, especially since the kid has never seen it. Despite his annoyance at being deterred from his plan, Elliot starts getting into it, even re-enacting the same movie snack ritual as he used to do with his dad -- pouring M&Ms into a bucket of popcorn. But Mohammed takes off when Elliot turns away for one second. Elliot eventually tracks him down at the mosque. They have a somewhat intense exchange, with Elliot admitting that he wishes he were dead, and Mohammed sharing that he feels like his sister left because of him and her death is now his fault. Elliot consoles him by explaining that it wasn’t Mohammed’s or Trenton’s fault. “It was mine.” When Elliot drops him off at his house before curfew, Mohammed asks if he can see another movie with Elliot sometime. After some thought, Elliot agrees -- to the movie and by extension, to not hitting “delete” on himself. Afterwards, Elliot returns to Sandesh’s house and mentions some shady memos he dug up in Sandesh’s work email account. If Sandesh doesn’t want those exposed, he better hold a funeral for Mobley and invite Elliot while he’s at it. Then he hands Sandesh the pouch of morphine he bought from Hard Andy, who as Elliot knew from the beginning, was one of Sandesh’s shady clients. Elliot suggests that Sandesh sell it back to Hard Andy in order to pay for Mobley’s funeral. Elliot goes to Angela’s apartment, but she won’t open her door. Worried about her, he tries to figure out what to say to snap her out of her despair. While she listens from the other side of the door, he reminiscences about the wishing game they used to play, when they’d close their eyes and wish for their heart’s desires. Since their wishes never came true, he didn’t get the point of the game at first, but she always said something before they opened their eyes to make it all better. Does she remember what it was? She sadly responds, “No matter what happens, we’ll be okay.” As Elliot approaches his building, a van pulls up and dumps garbage on the sidewalk, coincidentally (or not) including the Mr. Robot jacket and the computer hardware he ditched earlier in the day, which he takes as another sign that deleted data can sometimes be recovered. He finally installs a new bathroom mirror to replace one he punched towards the end of the first season. After setting up a new laptop, he goes into his encrypted mailbox. There’s an email from Trenton with the subject, “Don’t Delete Me.” When he opens it, the first line reads: “I may have found a way to undo the hack.” Elliot then realizes that maybe there are still things left for him to do.",
    "titleExplanation": "The “ko” is a Linux kernel module file (such as a device driver). “Don’t delete me” is commonly used to tell people, well, don’t delete this! Elliot is methodical about wiping down his computer and shredding files and folders. He does a lot of deleting in this episode –- even trying to delete a part of himself. But Trenton’s final missive is the ultimate “don’t delete” –- because she has an idea about how to retrieve info once thought deleted. Since E Corp’s digital data was encrypted, not deleted, there’s still a chance at retrieval.",

    "episodeSynopsis": "Like the Red Wheelbarrow BBQ takeout menu before it, in this episode, Elliot’s (Rami Malek) newly replaced bathroom vanity mirror serves as an important -- and no-tech -- mode of communication between Mr. Robot (Christian Slater) and Elliot. Let’s see how Mr. Robot comes to his soap-scrawled conclusion and what steps Elliot takes as a result of learning this critical piece of intel in the penultimate episode of the season. In a brief flashback, we learn why Allsafe originally lands the E Corp cyber security account. Hint: it isn’t as a result of Gideon’s hopeful-yet-clearly-inadequate pitch to Phillip Price, Terry Colby, and Tyrell Wellick. While Colby and Tyrell are busy rolling their eyes, Price clocks Angela (Portia Doubleday) when she enters the conference room. He seems to know her, or at least recognize her. After the meeting, Price orders that the deal be done immediately despite Colby and Tyrell’s counsel otherwise. Elliot resurfaces after another Mr. Robot takeover to find a message written in soap on his bathroom mirror: THEY OWN THE FBI. How does Mr. Robot know that? Did he see Trenton’s email and instructions, which were open on Elliot’s computer? If he did, then he knows that Trenton was close to figuring out how to undo Five/Nine and that Elliot intends to finish what she started. Mr. Robot also saw the news that the FBI has released Tyrell after being cleared all charges. “What did Mr. Robot do last night?” Elliot wonders. Flashback to… After seeing all that useful stuff on Elliot’s computer, Mr. Robot visits Tyrell at his family-less townhouse, where the FBI has just dropped him off. Mr. Robot gives him the what-for about how insane it was to go after 71 buildings. Tyrell says he had no choice but to follow the Dark Army’s wishes and even still, he lost everything thanks to Mr. Robot. At least he’s now free(ish). Mr. Robot tries to explain to Tyrell that there are still bigger forces to fight. Did someone say, “fight?” Tyrell dons his blue rubber gloves and takes a swipe at Mr. Robot. But before Tyrell can go full-on Rambo, Phillip Price arrives to tell Tyrell the “good” news: Tyrell has been appointed CTO of E Corp, though it’s a meaningless, powerless position. Mr. Robot accuses Price of knowing about fsociety and Five/Nine all along. Price admits he knew the broad strokes but contends that Mr. Robot’s “lone wolf” act only happened because a powerful man like Price allowed it to. According to Price, Mr. Robot needs to start acting like a leader by inspiring an agenda, not forcing one. After Price leaves, Tyrell goes straight for the vodka bottle, while Mr. Robot tries to convince Tyrell that instead of thinking of himself as a prisoner, they can use his new position to take down Price, whiterose, and their buds -- they just need to find their vulnerability. That’s when Tyrell drops his bombshell: the Dark Army has a man inside the FBI. Armed with Trenton’s intel and Mr. Robot’s revelation, Elliot goes to the arcade to plot his next move with Darlene (Carly Chaikin). They need Romero’s keylogger files, as that’s where he probably exported the encryption keys the night of the hack in case the revolution failed. But guess who has Romero’s drives? The FBI. And those files are on Sentinel, a super-secure network. Darlene suggests going to her contact and explaining the sitch. But then Elliot lays Mr. Robot’s headline on her, which is why they can’t trust anyone at the FBI. Darlene convinces him she has an “angle” on her contact. She’ll handle the FBI if he takes care of the Dark Army. After Elliot goes to see Irving to request a meet with whiterose, Angela is waiting for him on his doorstep, seriously out of sorts, like she hasn’t seen a shower or sleep for days. She shows him the front page of the newspaper about Tyrell being named CTO of E Corp, explaining that this is proof that they are “going back to the way things should be,” but won’t explain what she means. They go up to his apartment but Leon (Joey Bada$$) is there to take Elliot to the meet. Paranoid that Elliot was trying to stop her plan, Angela leaves. Leon brings Elliot to a deserted park and hands him off to a mean dude named Dr. Wang. Dr. Wang takes Elliot’s laptop and leads him to a grassy area where whiterose’s assistant is seated at a table flanked by two masked operatives. As the operatives copy the data on Elliot’s laptop onto a USB, the assistant says he was surprised to hear about the existence of Stage 3. Elliot explains that since Ecoin is what’s keeping E Corp afloat, the only way to fully take them down is by eliminating the currency. The assistant dismisses Elliot without indicating whether or not they’re on the Stage 3 bandwagon. Angela returns to her apartment, which she has redecorated with printouts of the faces of the 5,471 people killed in the bombings, alongside her favorite cat poster. She gathers some random belongings, including Qwerty and a photo of her mother, into a granny cart and goes outside in the hopes of summoning whiterose’s people so she can “warn her” and tell her “what they heard.” A white van pulls up and a Man in Black asks her to come with him. Darlene meets up with Dom (Grace Gummer) at their usual bar to try to snag her FBI badge number in order to access Sentinel, but the number is encrypted. So Darlene tries a different tack: flattery and seduction. They go back to Dom’s apartment but Dom places her badge, phone and gun in a safe before they get intimate. After Dom falls asleep, Darlene sneaks over to the safe and opens it but Dom is right behind her. Busted! Down at the FBI, Darlene tells Dom and Santiago that she knows that the FBI is in bed with the Dark Army but there’s a way to fix everything and be the heroes. In Santiago’s office, Dom argues that they have nothing to lose by trying Darlene’s plan but Santiago is suspiciously (not) reluctant and kicks her off Darlene’s case. Panicked that he’s been burnt, Santiago calls Irving (Bobby Cannavale) to ask what the plan is now. Meanwhile, whiterose is at her American apartment having a hissy fit that nothing has been packed for the move to the Congo. Her assistant boldly tells whiterose that the delay is ultimately her fault for believing Mr. Alderson and going through with the attacks unnecessarily. But whiterose stands by her decision because people like Price don’t “respect mercy.” The assistant says he will go back to their “partners” (hmmm…who dat?) with a more persuasive argument. He also mentions Elliot’s pitch for a Stage 3 but then says it’s not adding up since Darlene is being held at the FBI claiming she can decrypt E Corp’s data. That means that Elliot is lying: their target isn’t E Corp, it’s the Dark Army. The assistant says that it’s time for Elliot to follow in the footsteps of his father. Well, friends, as it turns out, there is no Stage 3. But by pretending there was, Elliot has been able to get the Dark Army to copy his file to their command and control server. When they open it, his exploit gives him full access to their management interface, which means, Elliot now owns the Dark Army.",
    "titleExplanation": "A \".torrent\" is a file used by torrent programs. “Stage 3” is Elliot’s hack, ostensibly to target E Corp’s Ecoin, but really to hack the Dark Army. He confirms the DA has hijacked his computer, he creates a PDF file he hopes they will download, the PDF executes malicious code, and he gets a backdoor to their network. Ta da!",

    "episodeSynopsis": "Things are far from bucolic down on the ol’ Dark Army farm in the final episode of season_3.0. Not only do Elliot (Rami Malek) and Mr. Robot (Christian Slater) bury the hatchet (so to speak) to fight the good fight against the Dark Army, but also they address a long-held misunderstanding after Darlene (Carly Chaikin) clarifies a key detail about their past for Elliot. When Santiago makes a fatally bad (and fatal) mistake, Dom (Grace Gummer) is forced to go against her every belief. And that’s not even the half of it so let’s get chopping. Whiterose’s assistant and his operatives kick in Elliot’s apartment door but Elliot and Flipper are hiding out in Shayla’s apartment. After they leave, Elliot proceeds to freak out. Even though he has infiltrated the Dark Army’s network, he doesn’t know what he’s looking for and there’s too much to comb through. Plus, he hasn’t heard from Darlene and -- with the Dark Army on his tail -- it probably means they’re on hers, too. Over at the FBI, Dom starts to smell trouble when she can’t find Santiago or Darlene. She tracks them down in the parking garage. Santiago gives her some BS story about having to transfer Darlene to holding but Dom’s not buying it. Knowing he’s been caught, he chokes and punches Dom in the face, knocking her out. She comes to with her wrists zip-tied in the back of Santiago’s car, next to a freaked Darlene. Dom has now put it all together: all the ways Santiago screwed her and their colleagues, Cisco, Trenton, and Mobley – not to mention the country -- were because he’s working for the Dark Army. He claims she would do the same thing in his shoes but she says she would never betray everything she stands for. (Never say ‘never,’ Dom….) Irving (Bobby Cannavale)  goes to see Tyrell (Martin Wallström)  at his townhouse. Before Irving can tell him why’s he there, Tyrell airs his feelings of hurt and betrayal by Irving. After artfully assuaging him, Irving asks where Elliot is -- him finding Elliot first is probably Elliot’s best option for survival given “all the scenarios in play.” All Tyrell will say is that he gave Elliot sensitive information that he’s “probably acting on.” At a loss for what to do next, Elliot goes up in the Wonder Wheel at Coney Island so he can talk to Mr. Robot face to face, as it were. After having a heart-to-heart about whether or not Mr. Robot knew about the 71 buildings (he didn’t) and if he did, would he have gone through with it (he would’ve found another way), Elliot asks Mr. Robot what he meant by the note on his mirror. The FBI has a mole and his name is Santiago. While they root around Santiago’s apartment, Irving shows up. Irving says that whatever scheme Elliot is trying to come up with won’t change the inevitable so he strongly recommends Elliot go with him now. Irving takes Elliot/Robot to the farmhouse where Tyrell famously chopped wood, cyber-stalked his wife and baby, and began executing Stage 2. They’re the last to arrive at the party: Darlene, Dom, Santiago, Leon (Joey Bada$$), and the requisite masked operatives are already inside the barn having a Dark Army hoedown on bales of hay. In full-on CYA mode, Santiago nervously says to a visibly pissed-off Irving that he knows he messed up by bringing Dom, but he thinks the situation is salvageable. “Uh-hunh,” Irving says in typical fashion before directing Dom and Santiago outside with him to Tyrell’s wood-chopping stump. As Irving removes his shirt and picks up the axe, Santiago, overcome by a too-little-too-late twinge of compassion, tries to convince Irving that they can flip Dom, despite her protestation to the contrary. But Irving knows she ain’t flipping. Besides, it’s not her head on the chopping block today. Irving heaves the axe into the air and lands it right in Santiago’s chest (which Irving explains to Dom he did as a “favor” he owed a “friend,” possibly his farmhouse buddy-slash-hostage Tyrell?). Ipso facto, Dom now has to step up as the new mole. Despite the high likelihood of death by axe, she refuses the job offer. Ever the convincing salesman, Irving deftly erodes her resolve by naming her family members and telling her to imagine that the additional swings of the axe he takes to finish off Santiago are for each of her loved ones. Terrified and broken, she weakly agrees to her deal with the devil. Meanwhile, Angela’s (Portia Doubleday) anxiously waiting for her audience with whiterose in a large country estate, which she believes to be whiterose’s. But no. It’s Phillip Price’s (Michael Cristofer) manse. When Price arrives, he explains that she’s there because he was worried about her. Angela insists that she needs to be with whiterose to help her carry out her plan. Ah, whiterose’s plan… Of course Price has known about it for years but dashes Angela’s hopes by telling her it’s a delusional fantasy. Oh, and by the way, Price tells her the only reason she was involved in any of this was so that she would drop the contingency from her suit. So why did Price bother protecting Angela? Because…that’s what you do for your daughter. That’s right, friends: Phillip Price is Angela’s bio-dad. He met Angela’s mother years ago when they both worked at E Corp. He loved Emily but was exceedingly cruel to her. When she got pregnant, she would not let Price have anything to do with the child and soon after, she met and married the man Angela has known to be her father. Price never planned on telling Angela until he learned what whiterose had done to her. Whiterose’s project stems from some obsessive psychotic denial of reality, for which she has murdered countless people. But Angela won’t give up the belief that there was a higher purpose to all the death as a result of the cyber bombing, which she’s convinced are her fault. Yeah, no. That one also wasn’t about you either, kid. “It was a dig at me,” he says. But no matter what her new daddy says, Angela is going to hang in there, just like the kitten on the branch, so she can see her mother again, because, you know, whiterose promised. When a blood-splattered Dom re-enters the barn like a zombie, Leon says it looks like she just got her initiation. Now what? Elliot thinks that they should chill because it feels like they’re waiting for someone “important” to come. Cue: the arrival of whiterose’s assistant, who first meets with Irving outside the barn. Wiping the blood from his hands, Irving reports that he took care of everything as instructed but bad news: he had to kill the FBI mole. But the good news is they got a better one. And now, he’s off on his much-deserved sabbatical in Barbados, which he earned after being whiterose’s “assistant” just like “Doll Face,” who now has to fly without the safety net that is Irving. Doll Face enters the barn and before he can say anything, Elliot, playing to the surveillance camera that he knows whiterose must be monitoring, immediately admits that there is no Stage 3. However, Elliot does own every single system that the Dark Army has ever compromised. So, if they hurt Darlene or him, the entire Dark Army history will get leaked. To prove he’s not bluffing, Elliot starts rattling off their various operations, including using Price to annex the Congo from China. He suggests that now they have an opportunity to leave with what they both want. The assistant says he knows Elliot wants to reverse Five/Nine but the Dark Army couldn’t care less about that as it has already served its purpose. As has Elliot. Just as the assistant gives the nod to Leon to take aim at Darlene, Elliot shouts that he has a plan to help them move their project in the Washington Township plant to the Congo. But the assistant doesn't like being one-upped by Elliot and the operatives grab him. However, instead of shooting Elliot, Leon shoots the operatives after receiving what must’ve been revised orders from whiterose via text during this exchange. Just then, the assistant’s phone vibrates. It’s whiterose calling from the bathtub! She chides him for letting his jealousy continue to blind him to “Mr. Alderson’s value” and gently informs him that their time has come to an end. Grant drops the phone, tells Elliot to take care of her, and then shoots himself in the head. Leon hands Elliot a laptop and tells him it’s time to make good on his offer, which, in this case, he wasn’t bluffing about having. Now it’s time to undo the hack. Dom logs into Sentinel to give Elliot access to Romero’s files. But to be clear, she’s only doing it because if her life as she knows it is over, she wants at least one good thing to come out of it. But Romero didn’t export the keys. Mr. Robot did, because it’s what Elliot would’ve done in case their plan failed. And just like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, Elliot learns he has always had the power to go back. The unmarked CD in his collection contains the necessary seed data and algorithm to regenerate the keys! This news, combined with Darlene’s revelatory clarification that their dad didn’t push Elliot out the window on the snowman day when they were kids (Elliot jumped after some kind of fit of rage), helps Elliot see Mr. Robot in a whole new light. So when Robot says he wants them to be a team and keep talking no matter what happens, Elliot is down with that plan. As soon as Elliot gets home and finds the photo that contains the data, he copies it into an email addressed to the recovery team at E Corp and hits send. But wait! There’s a bonus scene after the credits, because of course something wicked must this way come. As Darlene arrives at Elliot’s door, four guys approach her. One of them speaks to her, cryptically identifying himself only as “a brave traveler who’s finally come home.” And who might that be, pray tell? None other than Fernando Vera. Cut. To. Black.",
